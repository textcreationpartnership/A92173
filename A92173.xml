            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Publisher to the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, touching this inſuing treatiſe, bee pleaſed to underſtand that it was compiled, (ſo as now thou hast it, without any adition, or alteration) many yeares ſince by ſundry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and Godly Miniſters of this Kingdome, who in their times ſtood out and ſuffered in the cauſe of Inconformitie to the Ceremonies, and laboured the Reformation of things then, and ſtill in part remaining amiſſe in our Church: therein both for opinion, and practiſe, endeavouring to keepe cloſe to the Rules of Scripture, and what in them lay to eſchew all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and exorbitances, both of ſeparation on the right hand, and of ſuperſtition on the left.</p>
            <p>Who the men were by name, is neither now neceſſary to be publiſhed, nor, in reſpect of them all, certainely known. But what ſort of men they were that made it, and of what piety,
<pb facs="tcp:121037:3"/>charitie, modestie, and abilitie for this controverſie they were, the treatiſe it ſelfe by its owne light will ſufficiently diſcover to the unpartiall, and unprejudicate Reader.</p>
            <p>It is now preſented to publike view (after ſo long detein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) the rather becauſe;</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Preſſe is now more free and open (then in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times) to books of this nature, which doe ſo oppoſe the Schiſme of the Browniſts, as not at all to allow of the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and corruptions of the Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It ſeemeth now more needfull then formerly, through the late lamentable increaſe of opinions and practiſes of ſeparation, and the dangerous rents alreadie made, and likely to bee made thereby, even to the utter ruine of this Church, if by the mercie of our God, and the wiſdome of our King, and Parliament, ſome timely, and effectuall remedy be not provided.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hereby <hi>(good Reader)</hi> thou maiſt ſee that the opinions, and practiſes of thoſe that way addicted, now ſo much extolled, wondred at, and greedily embraced by many, under the notion of new truths, and a new and further light (as if ſome new created Star bad now appeared to the world, never ſeene before) are indeed no other, for ſubſtance, but the old errors and dotages of <hi>Barrow,</hi> and <hi>Greenwood,</hi> long ſince by them publiſhed, and by the godlie, ſober, and judicious in thoſe times oppoſed, and exploded. Save that now, like ruſtie weapons, they are newly furbiſhed, and being but the ſame mettalls, and materialls, are only cast into a new mould, with addition of ſome things more, of the ſame ſort, then they
<pb facs="tcp:121037:3"/>expreſly held; mitigation of others, by them more ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and rigorouſly delivered; and interlaſing of others, more pleaſing and plauſible to make the reſt relliſh and vent the better.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hereby alſo thou maiſt perceive, and take up the true judgment of the true ancient and preſent Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists of this Kingdome, in theſe points, as from their own mouth, and pen. Whereof (by the help of God) thou maiſt make theſe, and the like uſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Thou maiſt cleare them in thy thoughts from the miſrepreſentations, and imputations both of the Epiſcopall, and Schiſmaticall partie. Both of which would make the world believe that the Non-conformiſts have laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Browniſme, by their principles of Inconformity, and that if this bee lawfull, the other must needs bee neceſſary: The former ſort thus ſuggeſting, to lay the greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon them and the cauſe of Reformation, which they promoted; The latter ſort to procure the greater credit to their owne irregular, and unwarrantable courſes thereby. (And would to God that ſome other brethren (though of a farre better ſort, and ſuch as have long groaned under their Conformitie, had not beene, or yet were not too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſuch unlikely, and unreaſonable ſuggeſtions againſt their brethren.)</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Thou maiſt ſee that the cauſe of ſeparation may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed without relinquiſhing in one part, the grounds of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie, or leaning at all unto Epiſcopacie. As the cauſe of Inconformitie, may bee fully maintained without fetching
<pb facs="tcp:121037:4"/>weapons from or betaking our ſelves unto the Campe of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, which thing I could wiſh with all my heart, bad beene well obſerved by ſome (otherwiſe godly and judicious brethren) in theſe dayes, who no ſooner begin to diſtaſt and caſt off, their old burden of ſuperſtitious conformitie, (of late augmented, and made utterly unprofitable by ſundry other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations) but withall they begin to diſlike all ſet formes of prayer eſpecially, in our Lyturgie, as unlawfull, to queſtion their owne preſent ſtanding in the miniſterie as Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and to abſtaine from our worſhip, eſpecially our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Idolatrous, with other like unreaſonable opinions, and practiſes. As if it were not poſsible for men to leape out of the Surplice, unleſſe alſo they leapt out of the Church, and as if there were no middle betweene ſeparation from the Church and true worſhip thereof, and ſubſcription unto or practiſe or approbation of all the corruptions in the ſame. An error, in ſome ſort, formerly excuſable when oppreſsion (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ. 7.7.</hi>) and perſecution made even wiſe men themſelves madde, and ſometimes in hast, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene feare, griefe and anger, in avoyding one extreame, to fall upon another. But now, ſince that by the miraculous mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God) the ſtings of thoſe great Bees, are pulled out, and their hornes ſawed off, whereby they have ſo long afflicted, and willingly deſtroyed this poore Church, I ſay now, mee thinkes wiſe men ſhould looke before they leape, and ſo warily eſchew one errour as that they doe not unwarily run into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, perhaps a worſe.</p>
            <p>Lastly thou mayeſt be ſomewhat ſtayed, from haſtie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering,
<pb facs="tcp:121037:4"/>or inclining to their courſes of ſeparation, not onely by the Treatiſe it ſelfe, but alſo by the conſideration of the Treatiſers. For though no mans perſon whatſoever can be a ſufficient bottome whereon to ſettle any opinion or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in Religion, but the Word of God, and right reaſon alone, yet is not theſe mens example, or teſtimonie to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlighted, eſpecially in this controverſie, wherein wee are ſometimes almoſt deaffed with the praiſes of ſome of the ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators eminent learning, pietie, ſinceritie, zeale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which caſe I hope it need not bee offenſive to any, perhaps it may be profitable to ſome (according to the Apoſtles example in a caſe not altogether unlike, <hi>2 Cor. 11.22.</hi> to oppoſe theſe mens learning, pietie, ſinceritie, zeale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt the others; Who as in all other things they were examples of holineſſe, ſo in this, that they have ever, not only for borne but ſtedfaſtly oppoſed to their great reproach, dammage, and danger many wayes, the corruptions in our Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, worſhip and Leiturgie, and have beene lights and leaders to theſe latter times therein, yet alwayes in a peaceable and regular way, as not on the one ſide to ſubject themſelves to ſuſpitious inventions, ſo on the other, not ſinfully to ſeparate from the Communion and true worſhip of Churches; account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more agreeable to all rules of pietie, charitie, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prudence to tolerate for the time, what they could not mend, rather than to rent and teare all in peeces, to an utter ruine.</p>
            <p>To conclude, though perhaps ſome few particulars in this treatiſe may ſeeme more queſtionable, yet for the maine I
<pb facs="tcp:121037:5"/>doubt not but the Authors have held cloſe to the truth, both in their owne poſitions, and in oppoſing their adverſaries. By which therefore (good Reader) thou maieſt reape much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, for thy better ſettling in theſe unſettled times, if thou be capable thereof, and if the Lord ſhall pleaſe to adde his bleſsing thereunto. Which hee ſhall never ceaſe to pray for, who is, (all that he is) truly thine in Him,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing unto the <hi>Galathians</hi> theſe words, <hi>Brethren, If any man be fallen by occaſion into any fault, you which are ſpirituall, restore ſuch a one with the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, conſidering thy ſelfe, leſt thou alſo be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> both ſheweth the danger of falling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are ſubject, who ſtand in the Church of God, and preſcribeth the dutie of recovering thoſe that are fallen unto ſuch as are ſpirituall, That is to ſay, as are furniſhed with gifts thereunto, with the manner how all that ought to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: two neceſſary points in our judgements to be conſidered, and much tending to the preſervation of the good and happy eſtate of the Church of God: for how cometh it to paſſe, that Sathan ſo farre prevaileth againſt it; but for that weake men conſider not the danger of falling, untill they be downe, and almoſt paſt recovering; thoſe that are fallen, either not at all, or not untill they be well neere without remedy. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one eſpeciall part of holy wiſedome, for men <hi>who think they ſtand, to take heed leſt they fall,</hi> and therefore to ſeeke to kneow the depth of Sathans pollicies and ſubtilties, and then the effectuall means for the preventing of them, Into which if
<pb facs="tcp:121037:6"/>they carefully enquire they ſhall finde, that though hee ſeeke to draw even thoſe that have ſhined as ſtarres in the Church, from heaven unto the earth; yet that he much more earneſtly laboureth to make them wandring ſtarres, forſaking the place wherein they ſeemed to be fixed, to give ſhine and direction to others, that is, though hee laboureth and endeavoureth to bring men from their firſt love and zeale, unto a lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or key coldneſſe in the Church, yet he rather deſireth to lead them into a fierie ſpirit, and indiſcreet zeale from the Church and ſocietie of Saints, which no doubt he doth, as for many other cauſes; ſo for theſe two. 1. That he might by their departure, who have ſeemed zealous and godly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, ſhake the faith of others, and cauſe them to doubt, that they are not in the true Church; where they may finde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections toward the kingdome of heaven: and at laſt to flie from it, as from Babylon. And 2. that he might deprive thoſe men themſelves of the happy meanes of the recovery which they might have had eaſily applyed, had they beene in the Church, and remained in the fellowſhip thereof: Hence it is, that in the Church of God, thoſe who breaking the holy bands of love and faith, have like unkinde children forſaken her their naturall mother, and oft pleaded with her as a ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, which never was done in more convenient manner then of late, by certain of our brethren, who having been brought forth of the wombe, and brought up in the boſome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have not onely renounced, as a ſtepmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but condemned her, as one of the daughters, yea the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt daughter of the very whore of Babylon, railing on her, as if ſhe living in continuall ſpirituall fornications, brought forth ſonnes and daughters, not unto Chriſt; but unto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt his adverſary: By which their faults and fallings, as they have deprived themſelves of thoſe gracious bleſſings which they did long, and might have ſtill enjoyed amongſt us to their ſoules health, and made the meanes of their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very more hard and difficult; ſo have they troubled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted many remaining in the body of our Church, and of
<pb facs="tcp:121037:6"/>ſtrong men in the truth, brought them to be children again in underſtanding, eaſie to bee carried about with every blaſt of diverſe and ſtrange doctrines, how contrary ſoever to the truth according unto godlineſſe, either taught or received by them. The caſe thus ſtanding, we take it to be our duties, being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Miniſters of this Church, having by Gods grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome, though a ſmall meaſure of gifts fit thereunto, as to maintaine the credit of the Church, wherein we live. And to juſtifie the practiſe of our miniſterie therein, ſo farre forth as truth will permit; ſo chiefely to ſeeke, and endeavour both the recoverie of thoſe that are ſtrayed from the ſheepfold of Chriſt amongſt us, and alſo the ſtay of thoſe that are ready to runne after them, together with the better grounding, and confirming of them who remaine in the flocke, with comfort under their ſhepheards, which duty we have endeavoured to performe heretofore by publike preaching, and private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences as occaſions hath beene offered, and now have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed our labours in writing this treatiſe following, to the ſame end wherein after wee have proved by certaine reaſons, that our Aſſemblies, are the true Church of God, we take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to ſhew.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The foure chiefeſt exceptions, they take againſt our Church for warranting Schiſme, and ſeparation from us are vaine and frivelous.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the maine grounds they ſtand upon for the erecting their new Church, are weake and ſlender.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the beſt arguments that they uſe for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us, and juſtifying themſelves, are looſe and unſufficient: which points as we have gathered out of their printed books and written papers (where they were before ſcattered) and brought into one forme and body, ſo have we more plainely, and nakedly, both propoſed, and dealt in, paſſing by all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, and offenſive matters; And their flouting declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, petitions, exclamations, and bitter reviling ſpeeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Churches, Miniſters, and people, all their reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſlanderous profane ſcornings, fearefull blaſphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:121037:7"/>the Word preached, and Sacraments adminiſtred, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and holy exerciſes of Religion, uſed in our Aſſemblies, wherewith their writings, and printings ſwell to ſome bignes, as Bladders puffed up with winde. All theſe (though wee have given the Reader ſome taſte of their ſpirit in them) yet have wee not in our Treatiſe ſtood upon them, for that wee judge them not worthy the anſwer.</p>
            <p>This worke of ours, we commend, firſt unto our brethren departed from us, deſiring them to read it, without partialitie, ſelfe love, prejudice or other ſiniſter affections, and with meekeneſſe, indifferencie, and love of the Truth, deſire to be informed, and readineſſe to be reformed, where they erre and goe aſtray: It may be that God will give a bleſſing to it, nay ſure wee are, <hi>that he is faithfull that hath promiſed, to give unto thoſe that aske, to open to thoſe that knocke, and to cauſe them to find that ſeeke,</hi> the truth in ſincerity of their hearts, eſpecially if to the reading thereof, they adjoyne: Firſt, a review of the books which have beene written by the Ring-leaders of their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Secondly, a view of the perſons of whom their Aſſemblies conſiſt. And Thirdly, a conſideration of the eſtate wherein their Church now ſtandeth. In the review of the bookes which have been written, we exhort them with ſingle hearts, to examine the ſpirits where with the authors of them were led in their writing, and they ſhall finde it not to be the good ſpirit of God, which filleth mens hearts with meekeneſſe, humilitie compaſſion, ſoftneſſe, holineſſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſanctified affections, but that evill ſpirit of Satan, which under colour of zeale of Gods glory, hatred of ſinne, deſire of ſerving God in ſincerity, thruſteth men whom it hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into pride, ſelfe love, raſhneſſe, unnaturall affections, uncharitable ſurmiſes, and moſt unchriſtian judgment of their brethren.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to weigh wiſely what end they propoſed to themſelves in their writings, which will evidently appeare to be not ſo much the cleering of themſelves, from the crime of Schiſme, as the drawing of others to joyne with them, and
<pb facs="tcp:121037:7"/>the defacing of our Church, which they compare with the moſt Idolatrous, and heatheniſh Nations, that ever were, yea with <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> it ſelfe, and the disgracing the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters thereof, eſpecially thoſe whom heretofore they have moſt reverenced, whom they ſort with moſt wretched Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants, <hi>Iudas, Cain, Balaam,</hi> and many other, upon whom the ſpirit of God hath ſet a fearefull brand of eternall condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to try carefully the allegations of Scripture, wherewith they have fully painted the Margents, and with the multitude, whereof they have aſtoniſhed the ſimple, or credulous Readers, perſwading them, that their cauſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the ſame ground of Gods holy Word, and they ſhall plainely perceive, that the places by them alleadged, do for the moſt part prove that, which we denie not: And if they be brought to confirme the matter in controverſie, they are either unconſcionably, or ignorantly wreſted againſt, or beſides the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt. A ſecond thing which we intreat them to do is, to view the perſons of whom their Aſſemblies conſiſt, and let them tell us how many of them there bee, whom they have brought from groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, unto true knowledge, from infidelitie, to holy Faith, from profaneſſe of life, to a conſcionable walking with God; if there bee ſcarce any amongſt them, which have not bin of ſome note in our Churches, for holy and ſincere profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if they had no good thing in them, which they have not received by the miniſterie of thoſe men, and in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of thoſe Churches, which now they condemne, and flie from, why then take they the Seale of our miniſterie, and Church, and ſet it unto their blanke? Thirdly we exhort all of them to a ſurvey of their eſtate, wherein they ſtand, which is (if that be true, which by ſome of their own hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) full of diſorder and confuſion; And indeed how can it otherwiſe bee, whereas they teach that every member of their Church may, and ought to ſtand up againſt their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Elders, to gaineſay them in delivering of doctrine,
<pb facs="tcp:121037:8"/>and withſtand the other in execution of diſcipline; If he be perſwaded, the one erreth from the truth, and the other faileth in juſtice, is not this to make every member an eye, an eare, an head? And muſt not men be of Angelicall perfection to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve unitie, where ſuch large libertie is granted unto them?</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſort to whom we commend this labour of ours, be our brethren alſo who by the writings, doings, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of theſe deceived men, are in danger likewiſe to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, being brought to halt betweene two opinions. Theſe alſo we pray to read it with an holy purpoſe, to be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and ſetled in the truth. We hope their labour ſhall not be in vaine, if they will accept from us theſe few adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſments.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That they make not the example of any man ſeem he never ſo godly, religious, and zealous, but the Word of God only, the rule of their beliefe, and life; <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe muſt be followed no further, when the holy precepts of the Word, and the examples of the godly joyn together, we have the one to teach us, the other to incite us to doe our duties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That they carry an humble and lowly conceit of themſelves, and their gifts.</p>
            <p>That they remember,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Galath.</hi> 6.3.</note> that if any man thinke hee knoweth any thing, hee knoweth nothing as he ought to know; And that if any man ſeeme to himſelfe, that he is ſomewhat, when he is nothing, he deceaveth himſelfe in his imaginations.</p>
            <p>That to this purpoſe, they occupie themſelves in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their owne wants, and ſinnes, which cleave ſo faſt unto them, rather than in the marking the blemiſhes, &amp; note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faults that are in others, following the counſell of the Apoſtle.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galath.</hi> 6.4.</note> 
               <hi>Let every one prove his owne worke, and then ſhall he have rejoycing in himſelfe only, and not in another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that they have a reverend opinion of thoſe men by whoſe miniſterie they have beene begotten unto God, or nouriſhed in the truth, by whoſe labours they have beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, confirmed and comforted, in whoſe mouthes the Word of God hath beene unto them, as a two edged ſword,
<pb facs="tcp:121037:8"/>entring through them unto the deviding a ſunder the ſoule and ſpirit, the joynts and the marrow, that they ſuffer not a ſinfull thought to enter into their heads, of their vnlawfull vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, who have their hearts and ſoules, as Seales of their miniſtery, and may ſay to them as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>are yee not my worke in the Lord, if I be not an Apoſtle unto others, yet doubtleſſe I am unto you, for you are the Seale of mine Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Lord;</hi> whereof they ſhould therefore be the more carefull, for that it hath bin an ancient and ordinary policie of Satan, that hee might cauſe men to refuſe the word brought unto them in the mouthes of the Prophets, Apoſtles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men of God, yea of Chriſt Himſelfe to perſwade them that they had no warrant of their vocarions, and calling from God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That if notwithſtanding, all that is ſaid for their inſtruction, and reformation in this behalfe, they keepe a liking of that draught of a Church, which our deceived Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have framed and commended in their writings, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to joyne themſelves unto their ſocietie.</p>
            <p>They yet remember it is a part of wiſdome, to ſtay the full eſtabliſhing of their Church, and practiſe of the Ordinances thereof, for a time that they may ſee what bleſſings of God bee upon it, for the ratifying and approving of their doings: for if it bee of God, it will ſtand as an houſe founded upon a a ſure Rocke, if it bee of men, it will come to naught.</p>
            <p>A third ſort to whom we commend this worke of ours are our ſtronger brethren which continue with comfort in the ſocietie of their Church, them wee intreat that if they finde any confirmation or ſtrengthening unto their conſciences by the purſuing hereof, any increaſe of knowledge and ability to maintaine the truth of our Church, Sacraments and word, to defend the lawfulneſſe of our miniſterie, and practiſe of Gods externall worſhip amongſt us.</p>
            <p>That firſt they praiſe God whoſe gift it is, that any thing is ſpoken, or written for their edification, inſtruction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and then beſtow the ſame as occaſion ſhall be offered,
<pb facs="tcp:121037:9"/>to the reclaiming of thoſe that are ſtraied, and holding them that are ready to wander.</p>
            <p>Wee laſtly commend this ſimple travell of ours to the Church of God, whereof we are unworthy Miniſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching her to accept our poore endeavours, the rather, for that wee are not ignorant that the labours which we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this cauſe, will be diverſly judged of, according to the manner and affection of thoſe men to whom this worke ſhall come.</p>
            <p>Some, as namely, our deceived Brethren againſt whom we deale, will hold it damnable and execrable, as being beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Church of Chriſt, againſt the Saints and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, againſt the holy Truth taught in the Teſtament of Chriſt; yea, and that contrary to the light of our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and knowledge of our owne hearts.</p>
            <p>To the firſt part of this their charge and accuſation, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; That whether they or wee be the true Church of God: whether they or wee have the Truth taught in the Teſtament of Chriſt, is the matter in controverſie betwixt us. If wee be the Church of God and have the Truth of Chriſt, as we hope ſhall appeare by this Treatiſe, then have they written and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt the Church of God, and that in moſt ſhamefull and fearefull manner. If they be the true Church of God, and have his Truth (which we aſſure our ſelves they ſhall be never able to prove) then have wee ſpent our labours againſt the Church of God: But have we done it wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly againſt the light of our hearts; This is indeed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of their charge: but who made them the ſearchers of our hearts, and judges of our conſciences, that they ſhould accuſe us, to Im other and quench the light of Truth, which hath ſhined into our ſoules, eſpecially when they heare our proteſtations to the contrary, where is that Charitie that thinketh none evill, which hopeth all things; we ſay therefore unto the ſecond part of their accuſation with the Apoſtle, <hi>We ſay the Truth in Chriſt, our conſciences bearing us witneſſes in the holy Ghoſt, that we can ſay nothing againſt the Truth; but for the
<pb facs="tcp:121037:9"/>Truth, wittingly and willingly.</hi> And in the Teſtamonie thereof we pray God that our tongues may cleave to the roofe of our mouthes when we endeavour to ſpeake, and that our pennes may ſticke to the ends of our fingers, when wee attempt to write any thing againſt the Church, Children, or Truth of God.</p>
            <p>Some others, Fathers, and Brethren, Miniſters, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with us of this Church, finding by our manner of write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what judgemeut wee are, will hold our paines requiſite and neceſſarie, to ſtay the courſe of theſe waters which wee have given paſſage unto, and to make up the breaches wee have opened, by ſpeaking againſt the government eſtabliſhed in this Church, the Ceremonies uſed therein; and other our unadviſed dealings in the execution of our Miniſtrie.</p>
            <p>To theſe men wee ſay firſt, that as we have beene, and are perſwaded of the Truth of theſe things which we have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, touching the defects and wants, the blemiſhes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities of this Church. So have we in the ſincerity and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of our hearts, dealt for the redreſſe and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof: Wherein, though we know nothing by our ſelves before men, more then Truth will permit, if they ſhould have taken occaſion by our doctrine (which we perſwade our ſelves to be the doctrine of the Truth) to make this Schiſme; Yet were this no reaſon to reprove us, unleſſe thoſe men which have ſet downe true poſitions be to be blamed, as Authors of the falſe Collections and Concluſions which are inferred and gathered thereupon.</p>
            <p>Secondly wee anſwer, That our deceived Brethren do no leſſe condemne thoſe Churches of God, as the Synagogues of Sathan, where the doctrine which wee have taught touching the government of the Church, and matters of Ceremonies is maintained, and where all things which wee hold offenſive in our Church are aboliſhed, then they doe the Church of <hi>England,</hi> inſomuch that they have written of the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> (which is holden to be the beſt pattern of a Reformed Church) that it became a miſerable preſident and pernicious
<pb facs="tcp:121037:10"/>example even unto all <hi>Europe:</hi> whereby it is evident that they have beene brought unto this Sciſme by ſome other induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then the dealing of thoſe men in-the execution of their Miniſtrie, who are charged to be the occaſions, if not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is ſuch difference and plaine contradiction betweene them and us in judgement, yea in the matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Church government, beſides many other materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all points of doctrine, as we marvell any men ſhould eſteeme us cauſes of their defections from this Church, much more that any man ſhould write, That between the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and others (he meaneth them and us) there is no controverſie as touching the framing of a Church by the word of God.</p>
            <p>A third ſort of our loving Brethren, approving our care of Gods Church, and deſire to reclaime poore deceived ſoules, will yet happily eſteeme our labour altogether needleſſe and ſuperfluous, as ſpent and beſtowed both againſt a cauſe that hath ſo little ſhew of truth and ſemblance of probabilitie; nay ſo evident appearance of falſhood and vanity, as it is rather to be deſpiſed then confuted, and alſo upon men, whoſe zeale and raſhneſſe ſo far prevailes over ſound judgement, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that we ſhall rather ſharpen and increaſe their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, (by thinking them worthy anſwering) to a further contradiction, then either informe their underſtanding by ſound reaſon, or alter their affection by efficacie of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Brethren wee deſire to give us leave to diſſent from them, who judge far otherwiſe of this cauſe, wee handle and hope much better of the perſons againſt whom we deale: for the cauſe it ſelfe we ſay, that though it did appeare, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed full of falſhood and and vanitie unto theſe that have the gift to diſcerne betweene thoſe things that differ, and withall to temper their affections (which is the reaſon it prevaileth not with any ſuch to their ſeduction) yet unto men of weak judgements and ſtrong affections, or of more heat then know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it ſeemeth far otherwiſe, who are not in our judgements
<pb facs="tcp:121037:10"/>to bee contemned and ſuffered to be ſo headlongly carried in ſo violent a courſe, but rather with compaſſion to be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and with meekneſſe to be reſtored by ſuch as are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; If it pleaſe the Lord to give a bleſſing to their labour ſo ſpent and imployed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſeeing this <hi>Hereſie</hi> of theirs doth not only ſeeke to untile the Houſe of God built amongſt us, nor to breake downe the walls only, but even to overthrow the whole fram thereof, taking away the Pillars whereon it ſtandeth, the preaching of the Word and adminiſtration of the Sacraments: Yea digging up the very foundation thereof, and taking <hi>Chriſt</hi> from us whom (as they ſay) wee preach not, but denie in all his offices, were the falſe-hood and blaſphemie thereof never ſo apparant, yet were not the labour needleſſe, and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that is ſpent in confuting thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Seeing this cauſe hath been thought to be of ſuch weight and regard, that it hath brought the High Court of Parliament to make a ſharp Law for the preventing of the miſchiefes thereof, ſhall it bee thought a matter unneceſſary and fruitleſſe for Miniſters to deale withall, eſpecially where Lawes politicke can but draw the outward man to conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which is but Hipocriſie unleſſe the Law of God be annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto for the converting of the ſoule, and bringing the inward man, to doe that inwardly, and ſincerely which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly it performeth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Wee have the examples of diverſe Learned and godly brethren to warrant our doings, and to perſwade us of the neceſſitie of this labour, who either by commandement from authoritie, or of their own motions by occaſions offered unto them, have dealt not only by diſputation and conference, but alſo by writing and printing for the ſuppreſſion of this Schiſme and reclaiming theſe men. For the perſons againſt whom wee write, though we hold them all to be in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate (wee are loath to ſay in a damnable eſtate) as long as they continue in this Schiſme, and have cauſe to feare that Sathans ſubtilties abuſing the gifts that are in them, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:121037:11"/>them to pride, and conceit of themſelves hath hardened ſome of them ſo in their Schiſme, that they will hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, yet hope we, that as many of them have been brought backe againe to the Church, who ſtraied away with them, ſo the reſt may in time be brought to a ſight of their owne error by good meanes effectuall thereunto, ſuch as God hath ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to that end, and promiſed to accompany with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aſſiſtance of his holy ſpirit: This labour therefore of ours, we truſt ſhall not be in vaine, but have that work in them for their recovery by the bleſſing of God.</p>
            <p>If God vouchſafe us not this favour to be happy inſtruments of their good, yet doubt we not, but he that is witneſſe unto our Conſciences, how we long after their ſalvation, yea even from our hearts roots; will be our ſtrength, and our judgment and worke ſhall be with him; though they bee not gathered. But if it be remembred that our labours have beene beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.4, 5.</note> not only to raiſe them that are fallen already; but alſo to ſtay them that ſtagger, and ſtrengthen them that ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: though it ſhould be utterly unprofitable unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſort; yet being likely to prevaile with others, to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, it cannot but be acceptable unto God, and comfortable unto our ſelves, and ſo neither ſuperfluous nor unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>This now only remaineth (Chriſtian reader) that before we commend this treatiſe to Gods bleſſing, we advertiſe thee of two things needfull for thee to know: Firſt, whereas to many raſh and hot ſpirited men it may ſeeme, that wee have dealt in this cauſe too remiſly, ſo that wee have juſtified the corruptions of our Church, as hath beene objected againſt others heretofore; We anſwer, that our dealing may well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeem too remiſſe, whilſt the reader ſhall compare it with over bitter, untrue, yea, and ſlanderous biting and invectives of our Brethren: but being compared with it ſelfe, and with our Church, as in it ſelfe it ſtandeth, we hope it will appeare (ſure wee are that our knowledge) wee have not juſtified the leaſt thing therein worthy to be condemned.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:121037:11"/>
            <p>Secondly, whereas the worke is ſomewhat long, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſomewhat weariſome to the Reader: Know that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be much more briefe therein then wee are, both for that, not the reading ſo much as the writing of it out by them, that after the reading of it may deſire it, muſt needs be tedious; as alſo; for that fewer words and reaſons might have as well ſatiſfied the learned ſort: but whereas our deſire is to ſatisfie the ſimple, as having more need; by framing divers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers unto the arguments and proofes which we confute, and to make them plaine to their capacity and underſtanding, wee could not vſe more brevitie without more obſcuritie. And thus we commend thee to God, and to his bleſſing upon the reading hereof, that it may be a meanes to teach thee to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the things that differ, and to keepe thee from thy being overmuch juſt, leſt thou become too wicked. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, Wee enjoy and joyne together in the uſe of thoſe outward meanes which God in his Word hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the gathering of a viſible Church: for proofe whereof wee alleadge, that the meanes which we uſe and enjoy, have been effectuall to the unfained converſion of many, as may appeare, both by the other fruits
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:121037:13"/>of faith, and by the Martyrdome which ſundry have endured that were Members of our Church, and had no other meanes of converſion then ſuch as we have: Yea even thoſe men, who judge ſo hardly of us now are able to witneſſe with us in this caſe. That if their be any true faith and ſanctification in them (though it bee much increaſed, as they think, ſince they left us) yet it was begun and bred in our Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If theſe places of holy Scripture, <hi>Marth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Eph. ſ.</hi> 4.11, 14. bee well examined, it will bee found that the means, which Chriſt ordained for the gathering of a viſible Church, are the very ſame which we enjoy, even the preaching of the word, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments. That which <hi>Henry Barrow</hi> ſaith againſt us, in this point <hi>pag.</hi> 160. of his diſcovery <hi>(viz.)</hi> that there is not any one thing amongſt us either in order, or adminiſtration according to Chriſts Teſtament, ſhall bee hereafter diſproved, when we ſhall come to juſtifie our Miniſtery of the Word and Sacraments againſt their arguments or Objection what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                  <p>Now that this is an infallible and good argument of a true Church, appeareth:<note place="margin">Which is an in fallible note of a true Church.</note> becauſe; Firſt, There cannot any people be named, that, having theſe meanes, may yet by the word be evicted not to have beene the true Church. The Papiſts indeed bragge of theſe means, but without cauſe, for the doctrine of faith is not preached amongſt them, but oppugned, and conſequently they cannot have the true Sacraments which are Seales of righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9, 4.</note> which is by faith. Secondly, the Scripture every where ſpeaketh of the preaching of the Word, and adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as of priviledges peculiar to the Church of God.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>pſalm.</hi> 147.19.20.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So while the <hi>Jenes</hi> only were the Church, theſe priviledges were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 10 56.</note> and never made common to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> till the partition wall being broken downe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 11.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.</note> they alſo were incorporated to the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>So the Prophet ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2.</note> that this ſhould be the reaſon, why the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were moved to joyne themſelves unto the true Church, becauſe there and no where elſe the Miniſterie of the Word was to be found.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Our whole Church maketh profeſſion of the true faith: The confeſſion of our Church, together with the Apologie thereof, and thoſe Articles of Religion which were agreed upon in the Convocation Houſe, in the Yeare of the Lord 1562. (whereunto every Miniſter of the Land is bound by Law to ſubſcribe, ſo farre forth as they concerne the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, and the doctrine of the Sacraments) doe prove this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently; for how ſhall wee better judge of the faith which our Church profeſſeth, than by ſuch evidence. Many Papiſts and Atheiſts, are in our Land. wee grant, and many ignorant and wicked men beſides, who make not ſo cleere and ſo holy profeſſion of the true faith, as they ſhould: but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:121037:13"/>that our Church accounteth any one to be her Child, or member, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denieth Chriſt, or profeſſeth any other way to ſalvation, then faith which worketh by love, or who doth not profeſſe this faith an ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we confidently deny. Now this reaſon alſo hath force ſufficient to prove us the true Church; for as true faith in Chriſt is that which giveth the life and being to ſuch as are effectually called, and ſo become Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Inviſible, and Elect Church; ſo the profeſſion of true ſaith, is that which giveth life and being to a viſible Church: Upon this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wee finde many that have beene incorporated into the viſible Church, and admitted to the priviledges thereof, even by the Apoſtles themſelves:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act:</hi> 8.37, 38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.31.32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.</note> Yea and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> though he had neither faith, nor the ſpirit of God, yet becauſe he made profeſſion of faith, was judged a member of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, and baptized.

                  <p>
                     <hi>That all the Lares of God,</hi> both of the firſt, and ſecond Table are here broken, and forſaken, both of the Eccleſiaſticall, and Civill eſtate, and of every particular perſon in both, all things being innovated in both, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Iuſts and pleaſures of men, the Law, and Word of God being quite rejected and caſt aſide.</p>
                  <p>And in the 212. <hi>page</hi> of their refutation of Maſter <hi>Gifford, They

We will not give any anſwer to theſe ſpeeches, but onely deſire the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader to conſider, whether ever Gods Spirit taught any to write ſo ſlanderouſly; not onely againſt a whole Nation, (the converſion whereof they pretend to ſeeke) but againſt the bleſſed Truth of God; And how unlikely it is that they ſhould bee in the right way, whoſe chiefe leaders were guided by ſuch a ſpirit: That they ſhould be the Lords building, whoſe firſt founders and Maſter builders, had either ſo ſmall skill, or ſo bad a Conſcience: Doe we not hold all the ſame books of Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which they themſelves doe? Doe wee not reject out of the Canon all which themſelves account Apochryphall? Have they any tranſlation of holy Scripture beſides ours? Doe they themſelves beleeve, or teach otherwiſe in the Articles of the holy Trinity, of juſtification, of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination then wee doe? Hath every member of their Aſſemblies recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that ſpirit of truth, whereby they are led into all truth; as <hi>Henry Barrow,</hi> page 107. of his diſcovery affirmeth? And is there not any one amongſt us that hath not quite rejected the whole Word of God? Not any one that knoweth the doctrine even of the beginning of Chriſt? We know no better way to convince them in this, then by appealing unto their Conſciences, which we are ſure will take our parts againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Now this reaſon alſo is ſtrong to prove us a true Church, for although the bare letter of the Scripture may be found amongſt the <hi>Jewes</hi> and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and other Heretickes.<note place="margin">Which none ran doe but the true Church.</note> Yet was there never any people, that held and maintained the true ſence of the Scripture, in all points fundamentall, but only the Church of God, whereunto onely this title belongeth to bee the pillar and ground of truth:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tun.</hi> 3.15. A people may bee a true <hi>Church</hi> though they hnow not nor hold every truth contained in the Scriptures.</note> wherein wee deſire the Reader to conſider that a people may be the true Church, though they know not, nor hold not every truth contained in the holy Scriptures, but contrarily hold many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours repugnant to the Scriptures. Yet hath <hi>Henry Barrow</hi> affirmed in the 167. <hi>page</hi> of his diſcovery: <hi>That to the people of God, and every one of them, God hath given his holy ſanctifying ſpirit, to open unto them, and leade them unto all truth,</hi> Whereby it is moſt evident, that he would have none to be accounted the people and Church of God, who either know not, or practiſe not every truth contained in the holy Scriptures. In which opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſee, I pray you how groſſe and dangerous errors are contained.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:121037:14"/>
                  <p>Firſt, That to every inſeriour member in the Church, there is as much reveiled as to the Paſtors, and chiefe members, whereas the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Romans</hi> 12.3. <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4 16. <hi>eol.</hi> 2.19.</note> that the Holy Ghoſt is given to every member of the body of Chriſt, not equally, but proportionably, as the place, which it occupieth in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die doth require.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the promiſe mentioned, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13. Should be made to every member of the Church: which in the laſt words of the verſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth plainely to be particular to the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Church cannot erre: and ſo neither were the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> rightly called the Church of God, when they judged corruptly of fornication, and of the Reſurrection; Neither they of <hi>Pergamus</hi> when the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> was maintained among them; Neither were <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, true Members of the Church, who (though in the exerciſes of their Apoſtolicall function, they could not erre) yet knew but in part and in many things were ſubject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 9.</note>

Why doth hee uſe a ſpeciall art in ſome parts, rather than in other? And although wee doe not hold (as they falſly charge us in the forenamed page of their diſcovery) That ſome parts of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are of ſmall moment, ſuperficiall, needleſſe, and of no neceſſitie: ſuch as may be altered and violated without any prejudice, or danger at all to the ſoule, and much leſſe that a man that hath obſtinately continued in the tranſgreſſion of ſome parts, and openly taught the ſame unto others, may be undoubtedly ſaved, though he die without Repentance: but on the contrary wee beleeve, and teach that there is no part of holy Scripture, which every Chriſtian is not neceſſarily bound to ſeeke, and deſire the knowledge of, ſo farre forth as in him lieth: yet dare wee not call every truth fundamentall, that is, ſuch as if it be not obeyed and known, the whole Religion, and faith of the Church muſt needs fall to the ground.

                  <p>The only fundamentall truth in Religion, is this, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>

                  <p>The doctrine and word of God (though to ſpeake properly it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved authoritie onely from it ſelfe, and the Spirit of God) yet hath it ever beene the rather received by men, for the teſtimony the Church hath given unto it.

                  <head>ANSWER, I.</head>
                  <p>To all that they thus object againſt our firſt gathering this anſwer, we give.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That we might bee counted a true Church, though it could not appeare that we were at the firſt rightly gathered, for even as the Diſciples might be well aſſured of Chriſts bodily preſence, when they ſaw and felt him, though they could not perceive which way, or how he could poſſibly come in, ſo may we eſteeme them a true Church, of whoſe preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:121037:16"/>and faith, wee are well aſſured though wee cannot ſee by what meanes they were firſt gathered; Elſe wee may ſtill doubt, whether <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> and the families of <hi>Iob,</hi> were true Churches and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, becauſe how they were firſt gathered, and made a Church, or of whom, we know not; and yet we are now certainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they are a Church. Nay, wee finde good warrant in the word to the contrary, for we reade of many, (who having by that they heard, and ſaw) perceived evidently, that a people were the Church of God, did joyne themſelves willingly unto them, without enquiring how they were gathered or converted, as <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech, Rahab</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Eunuch to <hi>Philip,</hi> the Gaoler to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Wee might be rightly gathered to the ſocietie,<note place="margin">Secondlie, We might be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to an outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and to the ſocietie of the viſible Church by ſome other meanes, then by preaching of the Word Confutation of Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> page 152. and in the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Articles, page 44, 45.</note> and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the viſible Church, by other meanes then by the preaching of the Goſpell: for proofe whereof, we alleage their owne judgment and opinion, (which howſoever it be, yet hath force enough to ſtop their mouthes) namely, that men may bee won to the true faith of Chriſt, not extraordinarily, but even ordinarily, alſo by other meanes than the publicke and miniſteriall preaching of the Word. For if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Members may bee converted without this meanes, may not they much rather without it bee gathered together, and made an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Admit there were no other means, whereby a man could be ſoundly converted, but only preaching: Yet it is evident, that by ſome other meanes, men may bee lawfully brought to an outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and ſo made a viſible Church. Many in the dayes of Chriſt were prepared to heare and believe, and did alſo follow him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelves his Diſciples, that no man could, without ſinne, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them to bee members of the viſible Church, who yet were not all drawne by his word. But ſome by his Miracles,<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.23, 24.</note> ſome by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port they heard of him<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.39.</note> ſome by deſire<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.24, 26.</note> they had to be fed by him. Some Kings became nurſing Fathers, and Queenes nurſing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Church, their Lawes have beene meanes to bring men to outward ſocietie of the Church. And the practiſe of <hi>Ioſiah</hi> proveth, that men may bee compelled by the Magiſtrate, to ſerve the Lord.<note n="(d)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.32, 33.</note> Now as many heareing of the fame of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> came unto them, and ſo were converted by their preaching:<note place="margin">Thirdlie, Our Churches were firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by teaching of the Word.</note> ſo many that for feare of the Law, were firſt brought to the Church and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of the truth have beene and are effectually converted by the miniſtery of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Our Church was gathered by the preaching of the Word.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:121037:17"/>For, the firſt converſion of the faithfull of our Land, was by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpell, as is manifeſted by the teſtimonies of the beſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Hiſtories; Since that time, many have beene from age to age, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſame means, as by the miniſterie of Maſter <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and ſuch like, for proofe whereof this may ſerve that in moſt of the Kings dayes there have beene ſome, which have endured Martyrdome for the truth. Theſe ſecret ones did gather others ſecretly, ſo long as perſecution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and ſhewed themſelves openly, when libertie was granted; In the dayes of <hi>King Edward,</hi> great numbers were by preaching, ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, that in <hi>Queene Maries</hi> Reigne, many ſimple men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were able to maintaine the truth, againſt the learnedſt Papiſts, and to ſeale it with their bloud. Beſides them, there were many ſecret Congregations in many parts of the Land, all the daies of <hi>Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> which gladly received, and openly profeſſed the Goſpell offered unto them, by publicke authoritie, at her Majeſties entrance to the Crowne. If it bee ſaid, that they ceaſed to bee the true Churches of Chriſt becauſe they joyned themſelves, and became one body, with ſuch as were newly come from Idolatry, (and that not of conſcience, but for feare onely:) we anſwer; that they rather, that were fallen from the Goſpell in <hi>Queene Maries</hi> daies, were moved by Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> Proclamation, to joyne themſelves unto them, that had ſtood faithfull all that while: Neither is it truly ſaid of them, that in one day, by the blaſt of Her Majeſties Trumpet, at the beginning of her Reigne, all ſorts of men were drawne to a profeſſion of the Goſpell, without any further meanes uſed, for before any were compelled to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Goſpell; which was not till Midſomer, after her Majeſtie came to the Crowne, there were not onely many Commiſſioners ſent unto all the parts of the Land, that they might deface all the monuments of Idolatry, but ſundry Preachers alſo, which in the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> had received approbation, and exerciſed their miniſtrie in ſome of the beſt reformed Churches beyond the Seas, did by their doctrine both keepe them, whom they found converted) in the profeſſion of the truth, and called many others, of which number we may reckon, Maſter <hi>Knox, Leave, Gilbie, Sampſon, Whitingham, Goodman;</hi> and ſundry others. And there were daily added to the Church, by no other meanes, then by the miniſterie of the Word preached. So that if this were a good reaſon againſt other particular members, or whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, yet it cannot juſtifie a ſeparation from all, ſeeing wee have manie that by the preaching of the word of God, were converted and gathered.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:121037:17"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, This being proved that there was a true Church in the Land before Her Majeſties Reigne,<note place="margin">Fourthly though the meanes uſed for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>Church</hi> had not beene ſufficient for the firſt calling a people to the faith, yet were the ſufficient for the recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had fallen from the faith which formerly they had profeſſed.</note> the queſtion muſt not be whether the meanes ſhe uſed, were the right meanes for the calling, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a people to the faith, but whether ſhe tooke a lawfull courſe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling, and reuniting of Her Subjects unto thoſe true profeſſours whoſe fellowſhip they had forſaken; this was the courſe which <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat</hi> tooke,<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17.8.</note> who (to gather the Church which was divided) ſent preachers into ſundry parts of his Kingdome, and appointed Noble men to accompany and aſſiſt them by countenancing their miniſtery, and compelling the people to heare them.</p>
                  <p>This courſe alſo did <hi>Ioſiah</hi> take, who having aboliſhed Idolatry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all his ſubjects to the ſervice of the true God;<note n="(b)" place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 34.33. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 14 4. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.13.</note> Thus did <hi>Aſa</hi> uſe his authority, in commanding <hi>Iuda</hi> to ſeeke the Lord, and to doe according to the Law, and Commandement, and threatning them with death, that ſhould reſuſe: So did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by his Proclamation bring divers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> who were before ſeparated from the Church of God.<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Chro.</hi> 30, 12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Whereas they ſay, that at the beginning of her Majeſties Reigne, the people ſhould have beene required with ſolemne oath and covenant to renounce Idolatry, and to profeſſe faith, and true obedience to the Goſpell, after the example of <hi>Aſas</hi> reformation; Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If it had beene abſolutely neceſſary to the being of a Church that there ſhould be ſuch a ſolemne covenant by oath, to renounce Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie; this courſe ſhould be taken in that reformation which <hi>Ichoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah</hi> made, as well as that which <hi>Aſa</hi> made.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, even where this oath was taken, it was Gods true <hi>Church</hi> before the time of that oath and covenant made by <hi>Aſa,</hi> wee reade it was made and taken in the 15. yeere of his Reigne, when yet his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were the true Church long before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There be diverſe congregations in our Land, which in the beginning of her Majeſties dayes, and ſince, have publikely profeſſed their repentance, for their former Idolatry, and promiſed to imbrace and obey the truth, as it is profently eſtabliſhed; as in <hi>Coventry, North-hampton,</hi> and ſome other places. Yea, we doubt not to affirme, that the whole Land; in the Parliament, holden in the firſt yeare of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Reigne, did enter into a ſolemne covenant with the Lord, for the renouncing of Popery and reciaving the Goſpell.</p>

                  <head>OBJECT. II.</head>
                  <p>The ſecond thing they object againſt the whole body of our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies is this:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Object.</hi> The ſecond Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole body of our Church is, that it uſeth a worſhip of <hi>God</hi> which is pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the writings of men, as, read, ſtinted prayers. <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>That they communicate together in a falſe and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhip of God, which is polluted with the writings of men,</hi> (viz.) <hi>With read ſtinted prayers, Homilies, Catechiſmes, and ſuch like;</hi> which in the 24. <hi>page</hi> of their refutation, they call the ſmoake of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit.</p>
                  <p>To this Objection we give this anſwer. Firſt, That it is evident by the Word, that the Church hath uſed, and might uſe lawfully in Gods worſhip, and prayer, a ſtinted form of words: for we find a form of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the people preſcribed to the Prieſts,<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23, 24</note> a forme of confeſſion to be uſed at the bringing of the firſt fruits to the Temple preſcribed to the people,<note n="g" place="margin">

                     </note> So in the thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving uſed at the bringing home of the Arke, unto the place prepared for it by <hi>David,</hi> the Church tyed themſelves to the very words of 105. and 96. Pſalmes;<note n="k" place="margin">1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 16.8, 36.</note> and as one Evangeliſt reporteth, that our Saviour appointed that prayer which he gave to His Diſciples to be a patterne to frame all other prayers by.<note n="l" place="margin">

                  <p>Now to that, <hi>they object againſt this, that we never read, the Apoſtles did uſe this preſcript forme of words in prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That it is abſurd negatively to prove from examples of men, againſt that which God in His Word ſo expreſly, either comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or permitted; for we may as well reaſon thus: That we doe not reade that the Apoſtles, or the Church in their time, did baptize Infants. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They were not then baptized: or thus, We doe not read, that the Apoſtles did pray, either before, or after they preached, <hi>Ergo,</hi> They did not: Or thus, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not marry, nor take maintenance from the <hi>Corinthians, Ergo</hi> he might not lawfully have done it. The moſt Pſalmes, that <hi>David</hi> made, as they were committed to the Church Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians; That in ſinging them, were tied to the very words that <hi>David</hi> ſet downe; ſo they were not ſung as Meditations and doctrines for the inſtruction of the Church, but as prayers unto God.

                  <p>Concerning the Catechiſmes uſed in our Church, we anſwer; firſt, It is evident by the Scripture, that the Church hath for the inſtruction of the people, not only taught, and deliverd the holy Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

                  </p>
                  <p>And as the Scripture proveth this warrantable, ſo reaſon it ſelfe, and common experience teacheth, that it is a great help in all knowledge, to have ſhort ſummes of that we would learne, in our view, and proſpect repreſented to us, and to have that in order taught, that we would bee inſtructed in. So is the Saylor holpen by his Card, the Traveller by his Map, and the moſt cunning workman, by his patterne he draweth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be beginneth his worke.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, If Miniſters may (as wee have proved) in regard of the particular ſtate of their people, collect ſuch abridgments, and require the people to reſound them; then it cannot be unlawfull, for the people to reſound the doctrine in the ſelfe ſame words, wherein it was taught.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This being ſo, it cannot but be lawfull, and profitable for the people to have the Catechiſmes, and ſums delivered them in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in print, that they may the better read, and learne them.</p>
                  <p>Seeing we may have formes, both of prayers and Catechiſmes, we ſee not how this can condemne the formes which wee uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That in compiling, and collecting them, the invention, and ſuch other gifts of men are uſed, ſeeing there is a liberty left to the Church to doe many things, that tend onely to the ſetting forth of Gods Ordinances, (as themſelves confeſſe) and in the preaching of the Word, and in thoſe prayers which they call conceived praiesr, the wit, memory, judgment, and ſuch other humane gifts, are lawfully, and neceſſarily uſed, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering that the peoples underſtanding, and memory, may bee the better helped, by that they are well acquainted with them by the other.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:121037:19"/>
                  <p>If (we may uſe lawfully (as we ſee we may) even ſuch formes as were collected by men,<note place="margin">Secondlie, It is lawfull for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to uſe ſuch formes as have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by men of better gifts then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> and that theſe formes doe not any way ſtaine or prejudice the fevencie of the ſpirit, then doubt we not, but theſe forms that have beene ſet downe by men of better gifts, may as lawfully bee uſed of them, who throughly conceive the meaning, and truth of them, as thoſe which the Miniſter deviſeth himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>If formes thus deviſed by men be found to be lawfull and profitable, what ſinne can it bee, for the Governours of the Church, to command that ſuch formes bee uſed;<note place="margin">Thirdlie, It is lawfull to uſe ſuch good formes as are impoſed by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</note> or for us that are perſwaded of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them being impoſed, unleſſe they will ſay, that therefore it is unlawfull for us to heare the word, receive the Sacraments, beleeve the Trinitie, and all other Articles of the faith; becauſe wee are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Magiſtrates ſo to doe: whereas indeed we ought the rather to doe good things that are agreeable unto the Word, when wee know them to be alſo commanded by the Chriſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Though we are perſwaded by the former reaſon,<note place="margin">Yet we doe grant that in ſome caſes conceived prayers, are more fit then other.</note> to think that ſtinted formes, are ſo farre from being ſimply unlawfull, as in that, in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and generall occaſions of the whole Church, they are many times, more fit, then thoſe, that are called conceived prayers. Yet it is well knowne that our Law alloweth, and our preachers, alſo doe uſe prayers conceived, which we in ſome caſes, doe judge more fit to ſtirre up, and expreſſe the groanes, and ſighes of the ſpirit, then thoſe prayers doe wherein we tie our ſelves to preſcript words.</p>
                  <p>But why doe wee ſeeke to juſtifie our preſcript Lyturgie, before theſe men, who ſpeake as ſcornefully, and profanely of our conceived prayers, as they can poſſibly doe of thoſe which wee read? For when <hi>Henry Barrow</hi> had derided and flouted thoſe that uſe onely read pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; hee breaketh out into theſe ſpeeches, in the 37. <hi>page</hi> of his diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that other ſmooth hypocrites: yet as groſſe Idolaters, uſe this, (viz.) <hi>the Lords prayer, as a clauſe, or ſupply, to their long, and prolix prayers conceived before,</hi> whereby it ſhould ſeeme, that their hatred to us, (rather then to our corruptions) is ſo great, as that, whatſoever wee doe will diſpleaſe them.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Homilies, this anſwer wee give;<note place="margin">The reaſons they bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us for Homilies is of no force.</note> That though wee thinke it is not ſimply unlawfull, to reade in our Aſſemblies ſuch Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as are for the matter ſound and good: yet in regard of the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inconveniences, that may come, by uſing them by ſo many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Congregations in the Land, doe utterly diſlike all publike uſe of them: as that we wonder that theſe men are not aſhamed to uſe this as a reaſon of their ſeparation from the whole Church.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:121037:20"/>
                  <p>But what if all this were granted, that the uſe of our ſtinted pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">If to have a Dreſcript form of Lyturgie were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous yet might we be the true <hi>Church</hi> for all that.</note> Catechiſmes, and Homilies were Idolatrous, which yet wee have proved to be otherwiſe; will it from thence follow, that we are not that true Church?

                  <p>To the firſt ſort, we anſwer; that they have not yet proved our Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie Idolatrie. Secondly, if they had, yet cannot they by theſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies conclude, that therefore they that uſe it are not the true Church.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Wee doe wonder, with what judgment, or Conſcience, they can blame us for adding to the word by our Lyturgie, who will at no hand allow us to uſe, as prayers, any of the formes that are ſet down in the Scripture.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To this fourth objection we make this anſwer:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Seeing it hath beene already ſhewed that the diſcipline which our Church exerciſeth, is in ſubſtance the ſame with that which Chriſt inſtituted, they cannot with any colour of truth ſay, that all our Church government is Popiſh, and Antichriſtian, but only that it is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly and corruptly adminiſtred.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our diſcipline is Chriſt, and not Antichriſts 2 <hi>Theſ</hi> 10.11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.3. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.22. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.5, 16.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though it were confeſſed, that in the callings, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Biſhops, there bee diverſe things Antichriſtian; Yet ſee we not how our Biſhops could truly be called Antichriſts, or Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; becauſe, firſt the word when it deſcribeth Antichriſt, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us how to know him, uſeth to marke him out by his falſe doctrine. Neither can we find in holy Scripture, any ſuch accounted an Antichriſt or Antichriſtian, who holding the truth of doctrine, and profeſſing all the fundamentall Articles of the faith, doth ſwerve either in judgment or practiſe from that rule which Chriſt hath given for the diſcipline of his Church. Now it is evident, that our Biſhops both doe, and by the Lawes of our Land ought to hold and teach all doctrines and truths that are fundamentall: Yea ſome of them have learnedly, and ſoundly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the truth againſt Heretickes; that have gai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>aid it, ſome have not only by their doctrine and miniſterie converted many to the truth, but have ſuffered perſecution alſo for the Goſpell, and though <hi>Henry Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:121037:22"/>in the eleventh page of his diſcoverie call them Pſeudo-Martyrs, and run-away profeſſors, yet can hee not prove that they all ſince their accepting their rooms, renounced, and are fallen from that truth which they then ſuffered for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their Hierarchie, and other their corruptions that are charged upon the calling of our Biſhops, were rather to bee eſteemed as the ſtaires, and way to Antichriſtianitie, then Antichriſtianitie it ſelfe, which is evident by this, that they were in the Church before the Pope (who is the Antichriſt, and the chiefe head-linke of all Antichriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) was revealed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Antichriſtian Biſhops hold their preheminence, as from GODS Law, which is unchangeable; Whereas our Biſhops ſince her Majeſties Reigne untill this day (for the moſt part) held their ſuperioritie by no other right, then by the poſitive Law, which is varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Yea it appeareth, both by the inſtitution of the Courts of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and by the continuance thereof to this day, that they doe and ought by Law to hold their juriſdiction, not as from God, but as from he Prince.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, if they were, yet might we be the true Church.</note> Admit that both our Biſhops, and the government by them exerciſed were Antichriſtian, yet might wee that ſtand in that ſort, as we doe, be ſubject unto them that are the true Church of Chriſt; it is evident, that to ſpeake properly, the Yoke of Antichriſt is only inward and ſpirituall where the faith and Conſcience are enjoyned upon paine of damnation to receive other Lawes and worſhip, then that which God in his word preſcribeth, and even to this Yoke, the true Church hath beene often ſubject, or elſe the Church of the Jewes even in the dayes of Chriſt was no true Church that held themſelves bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to obſerve ſundry traditions of the Elders: In a more large ſenſe thoſe Prelates are called Antichriſtian, that joyne civill juriſdiction, with Eccleſiaſticall, or uſurpe more than they ought in externall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or tyrannouſly abuſe the power committed to their hands; and this Antichriſtian Yoke alſo, the true Church hath borne many a time: in the dayes of the Macchabees, there was a true Church among the Jewes, yet did the Prieſts exerciſe civill juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>There was a true Church,<note place="margin">

Their own termes they uſe in this, [<hi>viz.</hi> Aegyptian, and

                  <p>The laſt thing they object againſt the whole body of our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,<note place="margin">The fifth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Church is that we obſtinately continue in the aforeſaid wants and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions though we have bin duly convinced. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>To this reaſon, we alſo give this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>That neither doe our Aſſemblies continue in the aforeſaid wants and corruptions, neither if they did, ſhould they therefore ceaſe to be a true Church; for,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is evident, that many Miniſters and Congreations, have both by prayer unto God, and all meanes (that have been in their powers to uſe) teſtified unto men their earneſt deſire to have theſe corruptions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the true diſcipline eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The moſt of them that maintaine the evills that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and repugne the reformation which the reſt have ſought, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee juſtly charged with wilfull obſtinacie, or committing thoſe things wherein their own conſciences doe condemne them; for, ſeeing they profeſſe, and pretend that they are not yet in their judgment per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of theſe things, and the whole converſation of many of them: is, ſuch as gives us juſt cauſe to believe them, who dare be ſo preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to judge thus of their hearts, and conſciences, though hee were ſure they have wanted no meanes whereby they might have beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering that it is one thing, to have had the meanes of convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing another thing to be convinced: the former whereof may bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to us by men, the other by the Lord only; and that a people, in whom ſome right meanes of convincing have not been effectuall, may as well be the true Church of God, as they that have received and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all right meanes, that have beene uſed for their inſtruction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of life.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:121037:23"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have not yet had the right meanes uſed to convince us in ſundry of thoſe matters,<note place="margin">Thirdly, Wee have not had ſo much as the right meanes uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us in theſe things which are in controverſie between them and us.</note> that are in controverſie betweene us and them; for proofe whereof, we referre our ſelves to the anſwer, which we will hereafter make unto their articles in their concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Though not only the right meanes had been uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict us, but they had alſo ſo farre prevailed with us, that in judgment we ſaw the truth (which they ſay is not practiſed amongſt us) and in heart did affect it; yet would this ſufficiently cleere us from the crime of wilfull obſtinacie, that wee have not power without the conſent and permiſſion of Chriſtian Magiſtrates (under whom we live, by whoſe meanes we enjoy ſo many great benefits,<note place="margin">Fourthly, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee were all throughly convinced, yet have wee not power and warrant from <hi>God</hi> to redreſſe publike diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and erect the diſcipline without the conſent of the Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</note> and whom if wee ſhould thus farre provoke (we ſhould evidently hazzard the loſſe of thoſe things wherein the very life and being of a viſible Church conſiſteth,) either to remove the corruptions that remaine amongſt us, or to eſtabliſh thoſe Church orders which wee want; for although we doubt not but the whole truth of Chriſts doctrine, may be lawfully taught (though all the Magiſtrates in the world gaine-ſay it) and practiſed alſo ſo farre forth by every Chriſtian, as the bounds of his particular calling permits, and that it is the Magiſtrates principall honour, in the ſight of God, and man, to yeeld and ſubmit himſelfe to the inſtructions, reproofes, and cenſures of the Church, ſo far forth, as they are agreeable to the Word of God, who is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings: Yet cannot we not ſee good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to perſwade us, that the Church ought, or may either pull downe, corrupt Church government, or erect the right diſcipline, not onely without, but contrary to the likeing of Chriſtian Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>Thus much we finde in the Word of God.<note place="margin">Godly Princes</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That in thoſe publicke reformations of the Church, which the word commendeth, the Chriſtian and godly Princes were ever the principall actors.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That for the want of publicke Reformation, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is every where blamed, and no where the Church, for ought we can find: oft are the Prieſts, and people blamed for erecting and practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Idolatry, but never for that they plucked it not downe, when their Princes had ſet them up: Neither can wee finde whether ever the Church under a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, was by any Prophet, either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to deale (otherwiſe then by perſwaſion) in publike Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Magiſtrate neglected it; or reproved for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
                  <p>To that which they were wont to ſay; then the Apoſtles were much to blame, who in erecting the Church government, never waited for, nor ſought the Magiſtrates leave, and good likeing? Wee anſwer,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:121037:23"/>that though without the Magiſtrates leave they did it. Yet not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his liking, or when he oppoſed his authoritie directly, and inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, the never erected the diſcipline, when there was ſo direct an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made againſt it by the civill Magiſtantes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it could bee proved that the Apoſtles did ſo then, yet would it not follow, that we alſo may doe ſo now; for neither was the Heathen Magiſtrate altogether ſo much to bee reſpected by the Church as the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is; neither have our Miniſters, and people, now ſo full and abſolute a power, to pull downe, and ſet up orders in the Church, as the Apoſtles (thoſe wiſe Maſter builders) had.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, though this were all proved,<note place="margin">Fiſthly, though we did volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily continue in thoſe knowne wants &amp; corruptions having power to redreſſe them: yet might we be the true <hi>Church</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> that our Aſſemblies are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced in theſe points, and that we having power to reforme that which is amiſſe, doe yet voluntarily continue in thoſe wants, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, yet might we be the true Churches of Chriſt, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for as true faith in Chriſt, not morall obedience, is that which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth life, and being to every true member of the Church, ſo the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of true faith in Chriſt, rather than obedience, is that which giveth the life, and being to a viſible Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>So wee reade that many upon their profeſſion of faith were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and incorporated into the Church.<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12, 13 <hi>&amp;</hi> 16, 31, 32.</note> So that which made the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muns</hi> a true Church in the judgment of <hi>Paul,</hi> was, that their faith was publiſhed throughout the world.<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8.</note> And generally, that which made the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (to whom hee preached) a true Church, was that they gave obedience of faith, neither doe wee ſee what difference they will make betwixt the covenant of workes, and the covenant of grace,<note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5.</note> if they hold obedience to the Commandements of God, neceſſary to the life and firſt being of a true Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>And as a wife ceaſeth not to be a wife, though in many things ſhee ceaſe to be wilfully diſobedient to her husband, unleſſe ſhe ſin, either by deſertion, or whoredom, and be divorced.

So the <hi>Corinthians</hi> being in the firſt Epiſtle, convinced of the ſinne of Idolatry,<note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.14.</note> and other ſinnes,<note n="e" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12, 21, 13, 2</note> the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in them, as appeareth in the ſecond Epiſtle,<note n="f" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1.</note> did yet continue to be the true Church of God, notwithſtanding, and ſo are called in the

                  <p>THat wee have a true Miniſterie in this Land,<note place="margin">But it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that our Miniſtery is holy and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe the true <hi>Church</hi> hath received and approved our doctrine. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.3, 5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.6. 2.

                  <p>A true Church (ſuch as we have proved ours to be in our anſwer, to their firſt exception) could neither have received our doctrine at the firſt, nor proved it ſo long, nor have beene continued, nouriſhed, and built up by it: had not wee beene the true faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is evident, that many have beene brought (by our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery) to ſaving knowledge, faith, and reformation of life. For proofe whereof, wee appeale, firſt, to their owne conſciences, out of which wee deſire them to anſwer us, as in the preſence of Almightie God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By the manifeſt differences, that may bee noted betwixt thoſe that have beene taught by a learned Miniſterie, and thoſe that have bad none; who yet ſhould bee in judgement, and affection, as good or better than the other, if the Miniſterie, under which the other lived, were not true and lawfull.</p>
                  <p>That this reaſon taken from the fruit of our labours, is ſufficient to prove wee are the true Miniſters of God; As appeareth in this.</p>

                     <hi>(viz.)</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Popiſh Church and Miniſterie may be juſtified, as well as ours, ſeeing that many have beene converted by private conference, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and by domeſticall preaching, and exhortations, without a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church alling?</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, that though the Lord hath beene often wont, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and is able ſtill to convert ſoules by private meanes, and ſuch as are extraordinary. Yet cannot it be proved, that any have beene converted uſually, or that publike Congregations have been gathered, and builded up by any private interpretations, and application of the Scriptures, but by ſuch only as hath been uſe by a lawful miniſterie. And whereas <hi>Henry Barrow</hi> excepteth further, p. 152. and 153 and of his refutation, that this argueth only true doctrine, and not a true Miniſterie; we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>

                  <p>Secondly, That he affirmeth only, that true doctrine without a true miniſterie, doth ordinarily convert men: but proveth it not, nor indeed was able to prove it: as ſhall hereafter appeare, in the anſwer wee make to the ſecond Article of their conſequence.</p>
                  <p>

                  <head>ANSWER. I.</head>
                  <p>To which their Objection, we give this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The preaching of the whole truth of Gods Word, and nothing but it; the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and of publicke prayer, as they are all the parts of the Miniſters Office preſcribed in the word, ſo are they all appointed to our Miniſters by the Law.</p>
                  <p>And for ſo much, as there is no Prieſt-hood in the Popiſh Church, that is not ordained to offer that Idolatrous ſacrifice of the Maſſe, or that was ever called unto, and neceſſarily enjoyned thoſe duties of miniſtery that are required of us. Wee ſee not with what truth our brethren can ſay that our Office is the ſame, which Antichriſt calleth his Prieſts unto.</p>
                  <p>And if our Office bee the ſame which Antichriſt hath ordained, how falleth it out, that the Papiſts give a new ordination, to ſuch as having had that which our Church giveth, doe in Apoſtacie ſhrinke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And if it be objected,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Though ſome popiſh Prieſts are allowed to exerciſe the Miniſterie without any new Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                     <hi>that our Church admitteth ſuch as were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Antichriſt without any new ordination, whereby appeareth, that our office and theirs is all one?</hi> we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That though they have no other ordination, yet in more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts of their outward calling unto the Miniſtery, there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny differences to be obſerved, in the practiſe of our Church, that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man can thinke, we judge the calling, that any man hath had in popery, to be ſufficient for exerciſe of their Miniſterie in our Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The receaving of ſome into the Miniſterie, that have bin
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:121037:26"/>popiſh Prieſts, without new ordination, as we take it to be a grievous corruption, and ſuch as wee will by no meanes ſeeke to juſtifie, ſo wee thinke it cannot by any ſhew of good reaſon, be alledged to prove that the calling which all our Miniſters have, is the very ſame which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts exerciſe; but onely to ſhew either the outward calling, which ſome of our Miniſters exerciſe is, the very ſame with that of the popiſh Prieſts, or (at the moſt) that ſome chiefe Governours in the Church doe in their judgement, hold that there is no new Ordination,<note place="margin">The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt our office is, that we all receive one.

Thirdly, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he that is called to be a Deacon be reſtrained from ſome worke that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, yet is he not called to doe ought that is unlawfull.</note> to bee required in ſuch a caſe, both which if wee ſhould grant, yet had they granted nothing at all in the queſtion, that is betwixt us.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon whereby they would prove that office, whereunto our Miniſters are called, is not that which Chriſt hath ordained, but that whereunto Antichriſt hath called his Prieſts is, That we are called unto ſuch a Deaconſhip as is not according unto Chriſts Teſtament, but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and Antichriſtian? Whereunto we anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That if the Deaconſhip and Prieſt-hood <hi>(as they terme it)</hi> bee taken by us both at once, as uſually they are, then we are enabled to doe whatſoever a Miniſter of the Goſpell may doe of himſelfe, without the aſſiſtance of the Elderſhip, and ſo the errour that is committed reſteth in the forme and ceremony only, not in the matter it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though it were indeed to be wiſhed, that every office in the Church were called by the proper name which the Scripture giveth it; Yet if the Church give a wrong name to a right and lawfull office, the office is not therefore to bee refuſed, much leſſe, is the power to preach the word, and to adminiſter the one of the Sacraments, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bee refuſed, becauſe it is given by the name of the Deacons Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, conſidering that although in the ſtrict, and moſt proper ſence, the Scripture calleth them Deacons, to whom, the Office of caring for the poore is committed; yet ſometimes alſo all that labour in the word are comprehended under this name, and the miniſtery of the word, is called a Deaconſhip.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If it be objected, that our Deaconſhip, is neither approved nor mentioned in the Scripture, becauſe it reſtraineth us from dealing with the one Sacrament, and ſo ſeparateth thoſe things, which God hath coupled?</p>
                  <p>Wee anſwer, That this can bee no reaſon againſt our Miniſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when they are made Deacons, they are not called to do any thing that is unlawfull, but only cut ſhort for a time and reſtrained from ſome thing, which they may or ought to doe, much leſſe can it bee alleadged againſt all our Miniſters, becauſe many of us (as it is above ſaid) were made both Deacons, and Prieſts, <hi>(as they ſpeake fondly)</hi> in one day, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121037:27"/>ſo tooke the full power and authoritie of miniſtery without any ſuch ſeparation, or many as is here objected.<note place="margin">The ſecond reaſon againſt our office <hi>(viz)</hi> this we be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſuch names as are popiſh, is fond &amp; inſufficient.

                  <p>To which we anſwer, firſt, Concerning the name Prieſt, although we thinke, that at the firſt, it was well enough applyed to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Word becauſe it was derived from the Greeke Word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that ſignifies an Elder. Yet becauſe it is uſed now by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, as a terme of ſcorne, and hath a long time, both by Papiſts, and others, been by common cuſtome abuſed, and appropriated to ſuch as do ſacrifice, therfore not only the moſt of our poople refuſe to call us by that name but even ſome, who have been chiefe Governours of our Church, have judged it unfit to be given unto the Miniſters of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is well knowne, not only that many of our Miniſters are uſually called by ſuch names, as the Scripture giveth but alſo that the Law of the Land (in the book of conlecration) giveth us the name of Paſtors, Teachers and Rectors.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Though the names objected againſt us, have beene uſed by the Papiſts, and therefore are very unfit to bee given to the Miniſters of the Goſpell. Yet ſee we not, that either by their originall, or uſe, they have any ſuch contagion in them, as ſhould poy ſon and infect all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and duties whereunto they are applyed.</p>

We have Miniſters that read none of thoſe prayers that for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or forme can be proved ungodly.</note> All which proveth evidently the reading of the Booke of Common Prayer, is not taken to be of the ſubſtance of our miniſterie, nor abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly neceſſary, to the being of a Miniſter in our Church. And therefore we cannot but wonder to read thoſe accuſations (which are ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known to be falſe and ſlanderons) in their writings who pretend ſuch love to ſinceritie, and are ſo ſharpe cenſurers, even of the ſecret faults of other men.</p>
                  <p>Their fourth reaſon againſt the office we exerciſe, is, <hi>That wee are called to reade ungodly prayers?</hi> whereunto we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is moſt cleare that many Miniſters in our Church, uſe not to reade any of thoſe prayers, which you account, for the matter ungodly,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:121037:28"/>and that therefore this can bee no good reaſon, againſt all our Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, none are in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination called and enjoyned to read ſuch. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.11.</note> If all did uſe to read them; Yet are they not in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination called to reade them (as hath beene above proved) ſo that if they reade them, the fault is in them, and not in the office they exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If they were enjoyned to read ungodly prayers, and did accordingly read them, this cannot make their Miniſterie voyd, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, for then <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> ſhould have beene no Prieſt, for that he made an Alter at Jeruſalem, like that in all points, which was at <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> whereas it is evident, that he continued the Prieſt of the Lord ſtill: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that great fault which was beyond all compariſon greater than this, that is in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Their fift reaſon againſt our office is, <hi>That we are called to read, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and Injuctions,</hi> and whereunto we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That neither do the moſt of our Miniſters read Homilies; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any law of the Land require, that Preachers ſhould read them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If Law did enjoyne them to all, and all did read them; yet are they not enjoyned in our ordination, nor accounted by Law as ſubſtantiall parts of our office, neither is their any doubt made in our Land (no not by them that doe preſſe the preciſe obſervation of Law in this point) whether he be a lawfull Miniſter, who doth not read, either Homilies, or Injunctions.</p>
                  <p>Their ſixth reaſon againſt our office is, <hi>That we are called to marry, burie, and Church women.</hi> To which alſo we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That it is no part of our office (whereunto in ordination we are called) to doe theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the Miniſters uſe to bleſſe the Marriages, that are made in our Land, ſo make we no doubt, but that it is lawfull and fit (as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not of ſubſtance, but of good order) that they ſhould not doe it, for as it is neceſſary that this ordinance of God ſhould be ſanctified, by the Word, and prayer, ſo it cannot bee inconvenient, that the Word and prayer, whereby it is ſanctified, ſhould be adminiſtred by him, who in a ſpeciall ſort is appointed of God to be the ſteward, and diſpoſer of all his myſteries, and to whom in his miniſteriall actions, greater promiſes are made than to any other man: though hee doe the very ſame thing. And ſeeing that in theſe dayes it preventeth many dangerous inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to have marriages bleſt in the publike congregations, who can be thought ſo fit to ſpeake in the congregation, and to bee the month, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Lord to the people, or of the people unto God, as is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter?</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Henry Barrow</hi> objecteth in the 123. page of his diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; <hi>That he ever tooke Marriage for an Ordinance, and an action of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:121037:28"/>ſecond table, and ſeeth not why we may not as well ſet up the tables, of the money changers, or bring in any other civill matters or chaffaire, as this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Church; is eaſily anſwered;</hi> for though marriages be a civill action, yet is not the bleſſing of it, by the word, and prayer civill: And as the Magiſtrates may have a hand in thoſe actions, that are Eccleſiaſticall and belonging to the firſt Table, (even by <hi>Henry Barrowes</hi> owne confeſſion, in the 85. page of the ſame booke) ſo may the Miniſter have a hand in thoſe actions that are civill, and belonging to the ſecond Table. And though Marriages receive life and being, from the contract that is made by mutuall conſent of parties, and Parents privately (which is the cauſe why we doe thereupon according to the Scriptures, account them man and wife, before they have lyen together) yet doth this adde much to the ſeemlineſſe and beautie of that holy ordinance, when it is thus made knowne, and rightly ratified in the congregation.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Courching of women, we anſwer: That many of our Miniſters doe upon a juſt diſlike of the forme preſcribed in the booke, and upon feare of nuriſhing the great ſuperſtition (that the people for the moſt part have put in that cuſtome) forbeare to uſe any particular, and perſonall forme of thankeſgiving, at that time and occaſion: And yet wee ſee not how it ſhould ſimply, be unlawfull, (though very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient) to uſe ſome form of thankeſgiving, at that time even with ſpeciall mention of that occaſion, or how our miniſterie ſhould be made void, and Antichriſtian by doing ſo beſides that, the booke it ſelfe tieth no Miniſter to the forme preſeribed, but leaveth it to his diſcretion to uſe it, or any other, as that caſe or occaſion requireth.</p>
                  <p>Concerning burialls, we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That many of our Miniſters are knowne to refuſe the forme of buriall preſcribed in the booke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That a Chriſtian Miniſter may (for the honour and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of Chriſtian buriall) accompany, as a Chriſtian, with the reſt of the Neighbours, the body of Chriſtians departed unto the grave.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the miniſter uſe ſome few words of comfort and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at that time; Yea even in that forme, that the booke preſcribeth, though it may prove inconvenient, and offenſive; Yet is there no ſuch impietie in that action, that ſhould make his miniſterie void, or Antichriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Their ſeventh reaſon againſt our office is, <hi>That we are called to uſe Antichristian Geremonies?</hi> whereunto we make this anſwer. That the Ceremonies wherein opinion of Holineſſe is, or hath beene put, many of our Miniſters have caſt off, ſo that this reaſon maketh nothing to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie ſeparation from all our Church Aſſemblies.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Many that uſe ſundry of theſe Ceremonies doe it, becauſe either they judge them things indifferent and ſuch, as whereunto the Law of Chriſtian charitie,<note place="margin">b <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20 33. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.5.3.

                  <p>Thirdly, the uſe of the moſt unlawfull ceremonies that are amongſt us, is not of force to make our Miniſterie void, and Antichriſtian, or our Church for the Galathians were ſtill a true Church, though they had received even thoſe impotent, and beggerly rudiments, which they had once caſt off, much more wee, which cannot bee ſaid to have reſumed them, as being never yet freed from the bondage of them, ſo was there ſtill a true Church in <hi>Iudah</hi> when the hill alters, and high places were continued there, which yet was a greater corruption in the worſhip of God, then the ceremonies whereof queſtion is made, can poſſibly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is no part of our office whereunto we are in ordination called, to uſe any ceremonies as hath beene ſhewed before.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing they object againſt our Miniſterie is, <hi>That the manner of our entrance into the aforeſaid office and calling is Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and not according to Gods Ordinance?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereunto wee anſwer: Firſt, that the people may lawfully accept us to bee true Miniſters, whom the Church ſo eſteemeth, though they cannot ſee how we firſt entred. And that by no commandement or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Word, they are bound to enquire there-into. For further proofe whereof, we referre out ſelves unto the anſwer which wee have made to their firſt Objection, againſt the whole body of our Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though none of thoſe Rules which Chriſt his Teſtament
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:121037:29"/>hath ſet downe for the calling, and ordaining of our Miniſterie, can be wanting without a blemiſh, and maime to the calling: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they ſhould all of them be carefully ſought for, both by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and people, yet may ſome of them be wanting, without loſſe of the life, and being of the calling: Neither is that true which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; <hi>That whatſoever Miniſter hath not a true, and right calling, in all points, though the office whereunto hee be called, be a true office, is no true Miniſter, but an uſurper, an intruder, a thiefe, and a murtherer.</hi> For firſt, whatſoever is of the being, and ſubſtance of the calling to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, hath beene common to all true and lawfull Miniſters, that ever were in the Church, as well as the ſubſtance of the Sacraments, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and whole Religion, hath ever beene one, and the ſame, in all places, and at all times; whereas it is cleere, that ſome of the rules preſcribed for the outward calling in the New Teſtament, have not bin alwayes in uſe, and practiſe throughout Gods Church, no not in ſuch miniſtries as the Word hath given teſtimonie to; for proofe whereof may be alleadged the calling, that thoſe Levites, and Preachers exerciſed, whereof there is mention made, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.7, 9. For as in diverſe other parts of Gods ſervice, the omitting, and ſwerving from ſundry of Gods holy Ordinances preſcribed in the word, maketh not the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe void and unlawfull (as is evident by that one example, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30.26, 17, 18, 19) ſo the want and ſwerving from ſome rules preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, for the outward calling of the Miniſters, cannot be of force ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make their calling void, and unlawfull.</p>

                  <p>Their firſt reaſon againſt our entrance is; <hi>That wee are not choſen, by that people, over whom wee are ſet, or approved by an Elderſhip?</hi>

                  <p>Whereunto we give this anſwer.

                  <p>Secondly, the moſt of ſuch Preachers, as have ſtood for the cauſe of Reformation have the very ſame outward election,<note place="margin">Secondly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the ſame election and ordination in ſubſtance which the word requireth</note> and ordination in ſubſtance which the word preſcribeth; for firſt, their are be ore their entrance, ſufficient meanes uſed to know and finde what gifts are in them by diſputations and other exerciſes in divinitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, their gifts are approved by the judgement of ſundry lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men of the Colledges, and places wherein, and whereabout they have beene trained up</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the faithfull that are in thoſe Congregations, where they are placed doe either deſire them, or gladly receive them, or at the leaſt by not taking exception to them, do even by their ſilence, conſent to their entrance, or by ſubmitting themſelves willingly to their godly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in all things, and profitting in knowledge and Reformation of life by their labours, doe manifeſtly approve of them, and ſet a ſeale un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their miniſterie, whereof this may ſerve for an evident proofe, that many Aſſemblies have both made an earneſt fuite for ſundry Miniſters before their firſt comming to them; And when they have beene mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted afterwards.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing the right that Patrons now have, was given them at firſt by the peoples free conſent (though ignorantly, and unlawfully as wee are perſwaded) we ſee not why the choiſe that the Patron maketh, may not be accounted the choice of the people, as well as the acts done by the Knights, and Burgeſſes of the Parliament, are deemed the acts of the whole commons, by whom they were deputed; It is evident that by the Law mentioned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.8. that the ſilence of the husband, or parent that teſtified not his diſlike to the vow which hee underſtood was made by his wife, or child, made the ſaid vow of as much force, as if his conſent had beene requited and given, ſo it is judged in this caſe of the peoples ſilence, in accepting of their Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Law it ſelfe requireth that wee ſhould have the ſame election and ordination in ſubſtance which the Word of God preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for by the Law; Firſt, none ſhould be made Miniſter, but at the ſame time alſo be ſhould be appointed to ſome certaine charge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That when any Miniſters are to be made, there ſhould be knowledge given thereof, and that in ſo publike place and manner, that even the people, over whom any Miniſter is to be ſet, may know it, and be admitted, to take any juſt exception, they can either to his doctrine, or life.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There may be ſome entrance into the Miniſterie in ſubſtance ſufficient, where the people at firſt have not made election, nor their conſent been required at all: as in caſe where the people have not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:121037:30"/>of their right, or having known it have not been ſuffered to uſe it: But yet have afterwards yeelded themſelves ſubject thereunto, as alſo in the caſe aforeſaid, <hi>Numbers</hi> 30.8, for further proofe whereof, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelves to the anſwer we have given, unto that which they object in generall againſt our entrance.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Concerning ordination by Elderſhip, this wee anſwer in particular: Firſt, that unleſſe the elderſhip be held ſo eſſentiall a thing, that there can be no true Church without it (which we are well aſſured of that our brethren themſelves, and all that have any knowledge will denie) ordination by the elderſhip cannot be abſolutely neceſſary, albeit in the ſetled government of a Church, we hold it of the eſſence of the calling of a Miniſter, that we have the ſubſtance of the ordination ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Word.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, That as in times paſt; ſo now alſo there may be in ſome places ſuch an eſtate of the Church, as wherein no manner of ordination and inveſting of Miniſters, hath been, or could be uſed in the giving of an entrance into the Miniſterie: And though where it may be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently had, we hold it fit that the weakneſſe of the peoples judgement in their choiſe of their Miniſter, ſhould be ſupported by the diſcreet knowledge of the Miniſters and Elders that are about them; Yet where it cannot be conveniently had (as in places where the Goſpel is newly planted, and far removed from other Churches already eſtabliſhed) there that (amongſt other conſiderations) the courſe of the Goſpel ſhould not be ſtayed, till ordination be fetched from farre countreys; the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe oftentimes ſupplieth the places of the Miniſters and Elders, and layeth on his hands: ſuch evidence of gifts and graces proper for the Miniſtry, as not onely the Church doth willingly acknowledge; but the enemies alſo will they nill they, are in their conſciences convinced to be divine and excellent.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing it is evident that neither the Prophets under the law, nor many worthy Miniſters that God hath raiſed up ſince the time of the Goſpel, had ever before their entrance into the Miniſtry, their gifts ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly approved or been ordained.</p>
                  <p>Our Brethren muſt needs grant that this kinde of ordination is not ſimply or abſolutely neceſſary to the being of a Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>To which alſo this may be added, that our Saviour in giving notice whereby the true Paſtor ſhould be diſcerned from the falſe, nameth only theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that he enter himſelfe, and lead the people in and out by that dore.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:121037:31"/>
                  <p>Secondly, that the people of God agree with him and conſent to his Miniſtrie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the Porter (the holy Ghoſt) open the hearts of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to him and his doctrine <hi>(a)</hi> which 3. notes doubtleſſe our Saviour would not have reſted in, if there could have been no true Miniſter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ordination which our Brethren ſpeak of, and urge that as a matter of abſolute neceſſitie:<note place="margin">Their ſecond reaſon <hi>(viz.)</hi> that we reccive our Ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from Antichriſtian Biſhops, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alſo inſufficient for, firſt, Our Biſhops can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not trulie be called Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.</note> So that to conclude this point, wee ſay that the ordinary courſe of entring into the Miniſtrie is not kept; but a great imperfection and want is to be acknowledged where this electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ordination is not uſed; Yet is not the want ſuch, as taketh away the very life, and being of a true miniſterie.</p>
                  <p>Their ſecond reaſon againſt our entrance is; <hi>That our ordination is received from Antichriſtian Prelates, and ſuch as being perſecutors of the godly, cannot bee well accounted brethren, or members of the Church, much leſſe can they give a calling to a Minister of the Church?</hi> whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Secondly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Biſhops are ſuch as can judge of the ſufficiencie of gifts, and are alſo Miniſters It cannot be unlawfull for him that is to bee a Miniſters to receive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and authoritie from them.</note> That the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> cannot truly be called Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prelates, for proofe whereof, wee referre our ſelves unto that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer we have given unto their fourth Objection, againſt the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of our Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. ſeeing it cannot bee denied, that the Biſhops are able to judge of ſuch gifts as are required for the ſufficiencie of Miniſters; yea that many of them have beene ſuch Miniſters themſelves, as to whoſe labours, the Lord hath ſet to his Seale, and who have alſo ſuffered perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for the truth; we are perſwaded, that (though it were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yet) it cannot be unlawful, for him that entreth into the miniſtery to be approved, and authorized even by them.</p>
                  <p>And if our ordination be in this behalfe faultie, how will out Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren juſtifie the calling of their own Miniſters,<note place="margin">Thirdly, the gifts &amp; power to ordaine which God hath commited to his Church, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſeeke the benefit of it, even at worſe mensch n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, the ordination we ſeeke for, from the Biſhops, is not theirs but committed, to the Church by Chriſt Himſelfe: And ſeeing wee have already proved, that there was in <hi>England</hi> a true Church even then when this authoritie was firſt given by <hi>Parliament,</hi> to the Biſhops, and that the true Church (which without a miniſterie, cannot poſſibly bee continued) is never without power to ordaine Miniſters: Wee may lawfully reverence, and ſeeke for the benefit of this power, and pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which God hath given to his Church, though it were conveied unto us by men, leſſe capable of this authoritie, then our Biſhops are.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:121037:31"/>And he that thinketh Chriſts ordination, the better for the man, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth it, iucurreth (as we thinke) the danger of the curſe,<note place="margin">Fourthly. We may lawfullie ſeeke the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe from his hands only we can receive the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our Miniſtrie.</note> denounced againſt him, <hi>that putteth his truſt in man, and maketh fleſh his arme, and nith dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fifthly, If our Biſhops were not at all capable of this power to give Eccleſiaſticall Ordination, yet ſeeing the Chriſtian Magiſtrates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, is not to be refuſed by him that exerciſeth a miniſterie in the Church, and that cannot be had in our Church, but by the hands of the Biſhops we thinke that he who is fitted of God to the miniſterie, and hath alſo teſtimonie of his fitneſſe from ſuch godly learned Brethren as have made tryall of his gifts, and can judge of them, may lawfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and ſeeke for this kinde of approbation, if all other conditions bee equall.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Admit the Biſhops from whom we receive our ordination,<note place="margin">6. Though the Ordination received from the Biſhops were as corrupt as baptiſmal received from popiſh Prieſts, Yee may he be a lawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that hath no other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation then from the Biſhops Their third Objection agaiuſt our Miniſterie is, that our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration and exerciſe of that office where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are thus called, is alſo Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> were indeed Antichriſtian, or Heretickes (as we judge them not to be) yet why ſhould wee bee bound to ſeeke for any other ordination, more than another baptiſme, then that which we have received from Popiſh Prieſts in the time of ignorance; And ſeeing that <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Groen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> in the 54. page of their refutation, doe not onely account many to be true Chriſtians, that never had other outward Baptiſme, then that which they had from Popiſh Prieſts, but plainely affirme, that ſuch nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need, nor ought to be baptized againe; we wonder why they dare not account us true Miniſters, becauſe of this ordination received from the Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>Shall ordination bee thought more neceſſary to the being of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, than baptiſme is to the being of a Chriſtian; or ſhall an error in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, have more force to prove one no Miniſter, than an error in Baptiſme hath to prove one no Chriſtian; or are our Biſhops worſe than the Popiſh. Prieſts, or the corruption in the forme of our ordination, greater than thoſe that are uſed in popiſh Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third thing they object againſt our Miniſterie, Is, that the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and exerciſe of our function, is not agreeable to the Word, but Antichriſtian becauſe (ſay they) as at our entrance, we ſweare Canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Obedience to the Biſhops;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fifthly, Which is inſufficient to warrant their ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for it is not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawfull for us to yeeld ſome kinde of obedience to, Biſhops.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo doe we performe it in our whole admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, by going to their Courts, by ſtanding, and falling at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereunto we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that ſo long as the Chriſtian Magiſtrate requireth we ſhould yield obedience to the Biſhops (and that with this limitation, <hi>(viz.)</hi> only in things lawfull and honeſt) wee thinke it not unlawfull for us to give obedience to them, in thoſe things they doe by civill authoritie,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:121037:32"/>though neither themſelves, nor the Magiſtrate might well require us to doe, for even our Saviour Himſelfe yeelded obedience to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> in ſuch a thing wherein <hi>Caeſar</hi> could not lawfully exact obedience of him; as for the excommunication and ſuſpentions,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.24, 27</note> and ſuch other cenſures as are meerely Eccleſiaſticall? We anſwer. As the true Church of God, which from the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> hath received theſe keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, did though unadviſedly, and unlawfully deliver them over into the hands of the Biſhops: And the Biſhops being Preachers of the Word, though they ſhould not have this power wholly committed unto them, yet are they capable of it. We ſee not how it ſhould be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawfull to reverence and yeeld to the cenſures of Chriſts Church, being exerciſed, and adminiſtred even by them, unleſſe wee will ſay, that the Church preſently looſeth her right and power, to cenſure Offenders, when ſhe committeth it unto any ſuch men, as unto whom of right, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not at all, or not of right, only it belongeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, Not bind our ſelves thereto by oath, ſo far as we doe.</note> Now as wee may lawfully yeeld ſome obedience to the Biſhops in theſe things, ſo wee may lawfully binde our ſelves by oath to doe it: if our oathes be required or us by the Chriſtian Magiſtrates an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoririe, eſpecially ſeeing we doe by oath binde our ſelves, to obey in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the civill authoritie, which is committed to them, by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For our going to their Courts, this we anſwer. That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we doe teſtifie in our callings, our diſlike to the vile, and odious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of their Courts; And doe alſo utterly refuſe to yeeld obedience to any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> their unlawfull decrees, we cannot juſtly bee condemned for appearing intheir Courts, or any other place whereunto we are by His Majeſties authoritie ſummoned. And whereas the perſons before whom wee appeare are judged uſually corrupt, and enemies to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which wee deſire, and ſome of them alſo, ſuch as (being no miniſters themſelves) do by all meanes ſeeke the diſgrace of our calling, and the utter diſcoutagement of ſuch Chriſtians, as in whom they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any ſparkes of true zeale) wee account this our appeating at their Courts, not onely for an abridgment of our libertie, but alſo for ſuch a burthen, as wee have juſt cauſe to groane under, and to pray, that God would in His good time, move His Majeſties heart, to eate us of it. And yet as the Apoſtle being free was content, for the Churches ſake, not onely to become bound, in ſerving it with the labour of his hands, but alſo, by ſubjecting himſelſe to thoſe Ceremonies, which in Chriſt were aboliſhed, ſo may, and ought we for the Churches ſake, to beare this burden, rather than to forſake, or refuſe the miniſterie, when the Lord hath called, and fitted us unto it.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:121037:32"/>
                  <p>For our yeelding to the ſuſpentions, and deprivations, wee anſwer. That ſo long as the Biſhops ſuſpend, and deprive according to the Law of the Land, wee account of the action herein,<note place="margin">Fourthly, To ceaſe from the execution of our miniſterie when they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us.</note> as of the act of the Church, which wee may and ought to reverence, and yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if they doe otherwiſe, wee have liberty given us by the Law, to appeale from them, if it bee ſaid, that the Church is not to bee obeyed when it ſuſpends, and deprives us, for ſuch cauſes as wee in our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences know to be inſufficient? We anſwer. That it lyeth in them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that may ordaine; and they may ſhut, that may open. And that as he may with a good conſcience, execute a miniſterie, by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and calling of the Church, who is privie to himſelfe of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſſe (if the Church will preſſe him to it) ſo may he who is privie to himſelfe, of no fault that deſerveth deprivation, ceaſe from the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his miniſtery, when he is preſſed thereunto by the Church. And if a guiltleſſe perſon put out of his charge by the Churches authoritie, may yet continue in it, what proceedings can there bee againſt guiltie perſons, who in their owne conceit, are alwaies guiltleſſe, or will at leaſt pretend ſo to be; Seeing they alſo will bee readie alwayes to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Churches judgment, that they are called of God, and may not therefore give over the execution of their miniſterie at the will of man.</p>
                  <p>And yet admitting it were meerely unlawfull,<note place="margin">Fourthly, If this obedience wee yeeld to them were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawfull yet may we be true Miniſters of Chriſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</note> upon any reſpect to yeeld any new obedience at all, to the cenſures of the Biſhops; yet how will it follow, that this our unlawfull yeelding, hath force ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make us <hi>(ipſo fasto)</hi> no true Miniſters, unleſſe you will ſay, that the High Prieſts, who were in Chriſts time, that took and left their offices, at the will of tyrants, and heathen Princes, Were therefore not to be accounted Prieſts, for further anſwer, hereunto we referre the Reader, to that which wee have above ſaid to the fourth thing which they object againſt the whole body of our Aſſemblies; And to that alſo which wee have already anſwered unto the fourth reaſon, which they bring againſt our office.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeech of the Apoſtls,<note place="margin">The ſpeech of the Apoſtles. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19, 20, 15. moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt us. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.2.</note> which they are wont to object againſt us in this caſe, may eaſily appeare how unskilfully, it is alleadged to them that will conſider theſe three differences betweene their caſe and ours.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they that inhibited the Apoſtles, were knowne, and profeſſed enemies to the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Apoſtles were charged not to teach in the name of Chriſt, nor to publiſh any part of the Doctrine of the Goſpell, which commandement might more hardly bee yeelded unto, then this of our Biſhops, who though they cannot indure them, which teach that part of the truth that concerneth the good government, and reformation of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:121037:33"/>the Church, yet are they not only content that the Goſpell ſhould bee preached, but are alſo preachers of it themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtles received not their calling, and authority from men<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Galath.</hi> 2.1.</note> nor by the hands of men, but immediately from God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and therefore alſo might not bee reſtrained, or depoſed by men; whereas wee, though we exerciſe a function, whereof God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and we are alſo called of God to it, yet are we called and ordeined by the hand, and miniſterie of men, and may therefore by men, be alſo depoſed and reſtrained from the exerciſe of our miniſterie.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Objection againſt our miniſtrie is,<note place="margin">There fourth Objection againſt our Miniſterie is that our maintenance is not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſts directions, but Iewiſh and Antichriſtian, which is not of force to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our miniſterie, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee may be the true Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> although we receave maintenance from all ſorts of men.</note> 
                     <hi>That we are not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a cording to the direction Chriſt bath given in his Teſtament, but our maintenance is lewiſh, and Antichriſtian:</hi> That this is a principall matter objected againſt our miniſterie, appeareth in the fourth page of their Collection of letters, and conferences, and ſundry other parts of their writings,</p>
                  <p>And leaſt they ſhould ſeeme to ſay it only, they bring ſundry reaſons, to prove that our maintenance is ſuch, as no Miniſter of Chriſt, can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or live by, for ſay yee, our Miniſters receive maintenance from all ſorts of men in their pariſh without difference. This is alleadged in their collection of liberties and page 18. and called in the 145. page of the refutation. <hi>An execrable ſacriledge, and covetous making marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of the holy things of God, a letting out of our ſelves to hire to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, for filthy Lucre.</hi> To this firſt reaſon they bring againſt our min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, this anſwer we give.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is bound to uſe his authoritie for the furtherance of the ſubjects in all things that concerne godlines, and honeſtic, and ſo ſee that the morall Law bee kept by them, whereas therefore the Chriſtian Magiſtrate (in conſcience of his dutie) hath provided by the Law, that all his Subjects ſhould (of the increaſe God giveth them) contribute ſomewhat towards the maintenance of their Miniſter; we may truly be ſaid to receave our maintenance, rather from the Magiſtrate then from the people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Magiſtrate may lawfully appoint ſo much of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects goods (as by Law is given to the Miniſters maintenance) to bee imployed to this or any other good uſe, as is evident by that, which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Magiſtrate may without any ſhew of wrong compell the ſubjects to pay this part of their goods, which they give to their Miniſter, becauſe in Parliament it was voluntarily beſtowed, even by the people themſelves: whoſe free act that is, to be accounted, which is enacted and done in Parliament.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, It is evident by the Word, that the offerings which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens voluntarily brought, and gave to the building, and beautifiing of the Temple were accepted of, as appeareth in the ſtories.<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                  <p>Fifthly, Seeing the Apoſtle calleth it our owne bread,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mehem</hi> 2.8. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.12.</note> wee get by our honeſt labours,<note n="(b)" place="margin">

                        <hi>Luke</hi> 10.7</note> we may with comfort, and good conſcience, take maintenance of the wicked that live in our pariſhes, for whoſe ſake, both publikely and privately, we take paines, and to whom the benefit of our labour is offered; ſeeing that the Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth<note n="(d)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11.</note> that ſuch as ſow ſpirituall things amongſt people (though God bleſſe not their feed) may lawfully, and honeſtly, reape their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, As for the teſtimonie of the holy Scriptures, which our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren alleadge in this point, wee give this anſwer unto them. To the place, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.25. we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the meaning is, that a ſtranger being a Proſelite, might no more lawfully offer any of theſe uncleane, and imperfect ſacrifices ſpoken of in the verſes going before, then a Jew might.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the unbelieving ſtranger were meant here, yet is there nothing ſpoken here of the maintenance, which ſhould come to the Prieſts, for the intent of the Law, in this place is to ſhew what manner of ſacrifices ſhould bee offered to the Lord, and not what maintenance Prieſts ſhould have, which is evident, both for that the ſacrifice is here called, the bread of their God, and alſo for that elſewhere the Prieſts might receave maintenance, which might have blemiſh, as in the firſt fruits, and firſt borne. To that place, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15.8. and all ſuch like, we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that thought the action their ſpoken of (for the ſubſtance thereof) bee good and lawfull; yet as it commeth from them whoſe hearts are not purged by faith, it is indeed abominable in Gods ſight, as all other the actions of the wicked are.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That they abuſe this place, for it is there meant of the ſpirituall ſervices of God, and not of corporall maintenance, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it were to be underſtood of the maintenance of the Miniſter, yet ſhould not the Miniſter ſinne, in taking it, becauſe they ſinne in giving it; Becauſe by the Law, it was provided, that all <hi>Iewes</hi> cleane, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, good or bad ſhould pay tythes without exception. To the place <hi>Phil</hi> 4 18. We anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he ſpeaketh not there of maintenance due to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, but of the contribution, made to the afflicted Saints, and to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in particular, that had a principall portion, in the ſufferings of the Saints.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:121037:34"/>
                  <p>Secondly, if they urge that the maintenance of the Miniſter is alſo an odour that ſmelleth ſweet, and a ſacrifice acceptable to God, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that proceedeth from the wicked can be: wee referre our ſelves herein to the anſwer wee have made to the <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. cited by them to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Their ſecond reaſon againſt our maintenance is,<note place="margin">Secondly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though onr main'enance be fixed and certaine.</note> 
                     <hi>That it is fixed and certaine.</hi> This is alledged in the 61. <hi>page</hi> of their Diſcovery, and in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other parts of their writings, Concerning which we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that this can be no good reaſon againſt all our Miniſters, ſeeing that we have ſome preach ordinarily and painfully, who yet either live wholly of themſelves, or take nothing of the people, but that which they give voluntarily.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it be a great fault to live upon a ſet ſtipend, yet ſeemeth it ſtrange unto us, that they ſhould account it ſo great to make a nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our Miniſtrie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee can ſee no reaſon why it ſhould be thought either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull or unconvenient to ſet ſtipends to be given unto, and receaved by the Miniſter: for firſt, under <hi>Moſes</hi> law,<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.22 <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.2.9. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 21.18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.64.</note> a certaine and ſet courſe was preſcribed for the Miniſters maintenance, and the people appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they ſhould give. Now if it be ſaid of the manner of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall maintenance, that it was Ceremoniall, yet would we fain know what Ceremony or ſhadow there can be in the certainty thereof: Shall we ſay that together with the Ceremonie it ſelfe, all the equitie alſo and morall reaſon is abrogated.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> deſcribing the pattern of the new Sanctuarie that ſhould be under the Goſpel, alludeth unto a certaine and ſet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that ſhould be given to the miniſtrie:<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezr.</hi> 45.1.5</note> ſo there be fundry Phraiſes and Compariſons in the new Teſtament uſed by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, from which the ſame may be very probably gathered to be lawfull and fit, as when the Miniſters maintenance is compared to the wages and hire of a ſervant,<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.18.</note> and when it is compared to the ſouldiers pay,<note n="(d)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7.</note> which both things are certaine and ſet.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it ſtandeth with ſound reaſon that the Miniſters mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhould be certaine: For firſt, ſeeing it is already proved that a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient maintenance muſt neceſſarily be given to the Miniſter of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how can it be unlawfull, either for the people by their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or for the Magiſtrate by law to binde them unto that which they ſhould voluntarily do of themſelves? Secondly, by this kinde of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſundry of the peoples infirmities (as their grudging to give ought when it is in their power to give or not to give, their baſe eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion likewiſe of the Miniſter, and looking for civill dutie at his hand,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:121037:34"/>and many other ſuch like) are beſt prevented: Yea, we deny that ever any Church was ſo well informed, wherein the moſt part of the people had not need to have ſuch infirmities reſtrained in them, by the wiſedom and authority of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Touching the places of Scripture<note n="(e)" place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Iude</hi> 11.13.</note> in this point alleadged, by them we give this anſwer. Firſt, that they condemne onely the covetouſneſſe of men, and not the ſet maintenance of Miniſters, which may be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without covetouſneſſe. Secondly, if they will enforce theſe places againſt ſet payments to the Miniſter, they may as well enforce them againſt all ſet payments to the Prince, to the ſervant, to the labourer, or any other. Thirdly if not, then ſeeing the Apoſtles rule<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.</note> doth concern even the Miniſters as well as others, why ſhould it be thought covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him to provide a certaine and ſet maintenance for himſelfe and his family, more then the ſame care is in any other Chriſtian?</p>
                  <p>To the place <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. we ſay that the Commandment which our Saviour Chriſt gave there to his diſciples was temporary, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that eſpeciall voyage onely wherein (for their incouragement to the Miniſtry) our Saviour aſſureth them, that they ſhould not need to feare the want of maintenance; for he would ſupply that extraordinarily as it were, by his eſpeciall providence, in inclining the hearts of men to maintaine them: And that this is ſo, may appeare by theſe reaſons.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verſe</hi> 7.8.</note> Firſt, if it be a perpetuall rule we may thence gather, 1. that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ought now to have no abiding place, neither two coates, two paire of ſhooes, nor a ſtaffe; neither that they may poſſeſſe any thing of their owne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they then received their gifts of preaching and working of miracles freely without coſt, and therefore were bound from cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting for ſtipend, to diſpence thoſe gifts, receaving no more then for their preſent neceſſitie of food and raiment, which cannot be ſo ſaid of thoſe, whoſe bringing up in learning is coſtly, and whoſe ſtudy is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by the commandement which our Saviour Chriſt giveth<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 22.35 36. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 96, 7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.</note> for proviſion for themſelves; And that which <hi>Paul</hi> challengeth, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the reſtraint given, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. was but temporarie, yea ad mit it might be proved from hence, that no ſet maintenance were given to the Miniſters during the Apoſtles time (which cannot be) yet follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that there ſhould be none: Now ſeeing that the Church was then without thoſe nouriſhing fathers which the Lord promiſed by the Prophet,<note n="(c)" place="margin">

                     </note> without whoſe authoritie wee ſee not how that order for forced maintenance could be taken. Neither doubt we to acknowledge even this for a ſpeciall fruit of that bleſſing promiſed to come to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:121037:35"/>Church by Chriſtian Magiſtrates, whereas they ſaid, <hi>that whatſoever is given to the maintenance of Gods Service, ſhould be free, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and alleadge for that, theſe places, <hi>Exodus</hi> 15.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5, 7. we anſwer. That the bond of the peoples promiſe, and Magiſtrates Law is no hinderance, to the freedom and voluntarines, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſervice, and obedience of <hi>David</hi> was free and voluntary; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the vow and oath hee bound himſelfe with.<note place="margin">

                  <p>The third reaſon they alleadge againſt our maintenance,<note place="margin">Thirdly. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we bee maintained by Tythes.</note> Is this; <hi>That we are maintained by Iewiſh tythes, and concerning which, they have theſe words,</hi> In the 60. page of their diſcoverie; <hi>It is evident, who are thus maintained by thoſe Iewiſh Tythes, and offerings, are not the miniſters of Chriſt, and a little after, theſe Prieſts, and people ſtill retaine the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall decimations, in the ſame forme, to the ſame ends. And</hi> page 16. <hi>I could never ſee any difference betweene the Iewes and them, ſave that the Swine-heards, tythe-Pïgges and Geeſe, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To all which, wee thus anſwer: Firſt, It is evident, that the tythes are not held amongſt us, by vertue of the Leviticall Law, but only by the poſitive Law of our Land, for proofe whereof, theſe reaſons following may be ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If this kinde of maintenance were given to the Miniſter, for conſcience and obedience to that Law; why ſhould not the firſt fruits alſo, offerings and diverſe other things, which by a plaine commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were due to the Leviticall Prieſt-hood bee given us as well as tythes?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The manner of tything (which in diverſe parts of our Land is diverſly uſed, and which through cuſtome alſo, is many wayes altered) proveth that paying of tythes amongſt us, is not according to the Leviticall Law, nor in religeous obedience thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Law (by conſent of the ſtates in the Parliament) hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alenated, the tythes in many places, from the Miniſter, unto the Prince, and other men; doth thereby declare, that it appointeth not the paying of the tythes, by vertue of the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Sundry of our Miniſters are (and that even in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our whole Church) lawfully by other meanes maintained, then by tythes, which is alſo a plaine demonſtration, that both the Leuiticall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:121037:35"/>Law is not held to be in force with us; and if it were, wee might yet have ſome true Miniſters in our Land notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the Prince (without any ſhew of Jewiſh ſuperſtition) may require of the Miniſters firſt fruits, and tenths, and of all the reſt of the ſubjects fifteenes, and ſubſidies for the maintenance of the wars, and other civill purpoſes, ſo doubt we not, but he may as well eſpecially by act of Parliament (which is alſo the act of the people) require tenths of his people to the maintenance of the miniſterie, of which (as wee have ſaid before) he is bound to have a more ſpeciall care, and regard then of the maintenance of the warres, or any other civill eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Their fourth reaſon againſt our maintenance is,<note place="margin">Fourthly, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we bee maintained by offerings and mortuary.</note> 
                     <hi>That it ariſeth from popiſh offerings and mortuaries:</hi> Concerning which, wee anſwer, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Their be ſundry of our Miniſters that receive none at all, againſt whoſe Congregations, and Miniſters, this reaſon cannot hold, and many even of them to whom the Law alloweth offerings, have refuſed them that were accuſtomed to bee given at the Churchings, and burialls, and ſuch other, as the receiving whereof, they ſee would bee likely to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſuperſtition in the people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If all did receive and live by offerings, we ſee not what pollution can come to their miniſterie thereby, for why may not that creature of God, which was firſt given to profane, and ſuperſtitious uſes, bee now lawfully tranſlated to the maintenance of Gods ſervice, ſeeing that even under the Law, tranſlation was lawfull, when (for a Ceremony, to ſhadow what deteſtation the people of God ſhould beare to the manners of the heathen, and how they ſhould be ſeparated from them:) Many things were made uncleane to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that are not ſo to us; So alſo the Iron, and Braſſe, Silver, and Gold of Jericho,<note place="margin">a <hi>Ioſua</hi> 6.24.</note> was put into the treaſure of Gods houſe, as appeareth in the ſtory of <hi>Joſhuab:</hi> And <hi>David</hi> dedicated unto the <hi>Lord, the braſſe, and ſilver, and gold, of all the Nations, that he ſubdued;</hi> as may alſo appeare by <hi>Samuel.</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11.</note> Now if thoſe goods that were not onely put a part to an Idolatrous uſe, by a civill inſtitution, but alſo actually abuſed to Idolatrie, might yet lawfully bereceaved for the maintenance of the true ſervice of God, how much more may the mony wee receave for offerings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be lawfully taken and enjoyed by us, ſeeing whatſoever originall the money, and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had, yet was it never applyed to any Idolatrous uſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If thoſe offerings were polluted things, yet are they too accidentall to overthrow the very being, and nature of our miniſterie.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing they object againſt our people is, <hi>That the beſt of them are without true faith, becauſe they live not in obedience of Chriſt, ſet up among them, nor practiſe his Ordinances?</hi> Whereunto wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>

                  <p>To the places of holy Scripture, which they alleadge for this their ſecond Objection againſt our people? we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That ſome of them,<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.34. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44.8, 9. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9.</note> concerne the inviſible Church, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ignorantly applyed to the deſcription of them that are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church viſible.</p>
                  <p>As if no meaſure of faith, and holineſſe, were to be allowed by men in the judging of the members of the Church viſible, but that onely which the Lord Himſelfe alloweth of in juding of the elect Members of the viſible Church: Whereas it is evident, that to the making of the Members of the viſible Church, an outward obedience and profeſſion of faith is ſufficient, though there be no inward grace, nor truth in the heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That ſome of them require indeed, that every Chriſtian ſhould ſeeke the Kingdome of God, and the place where God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, according to his Word, ſubmit themſelves to the Yoke of Chriſt, and to obey him in all his Ordinances: but that the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either the Magiſtrate, or Miniſters helpe, or conſent, ſhould reform the Church, and erect the diſcipline, they are ſo farre from command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if they be well compared, with that wee have above ſaid, they will be found to command the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>The third thing they object againſt our people, Is, <hi>That though ſome of them had once beene faithfull, yet by tollerating in their Aſſemblies, the open prophane, by wanting power to caſt them out, and communicateing with them in their worſhip of God, they are now become not ue Church of Chriſt?</hi> Whereunto we anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the godly which are in our Aſſemblies, do not at all tollerate the wicked profane, but doe as much (as in them lieth) ſhew their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to them, mourning alſo for their profaneneſſe, and for the want of Chriſtian diſcipline, whereby they might be ſeparated: Yea the very Lawes of our Church (as hath beene above ſaid) doe ſeparate from our Aſſemblies the open prophane.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:121037:38"/>
                  <p>Secondly, admit they did not at all ſhut out the prophanie (either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not their right, or for that they are hindred and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to doe it, or that they ſin in not uſing their right in this caſe) or if it were granted that the people, even the private members of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies had full authoritie given them by Chriſt, without the Miniſters or Magiſtrates conſent to caſt out and excommunicate the open profane (the contrary whereof hath been before ſufficiently proved) yet might they as lawfully for want of power, or for ſuch inconveniences tollerate the prophanie amongſt them, and ſo forbeare the execution of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in this caſe, as either <hi>David</hi> did ſpare <hi>Joab,</hi>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>FRom theſe three Exceptions that have beene above anſwered, they inferre this concluſion, that therefore they may lawfully, and ought to ſeparate themſelves from us in ſuch ſort, as they doe. In this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there are two Articles, whereunto we will anſwer ſeverally.</p>
               <p>The firſt Article in their concluſion is this: <hi>The Aſſemblies which we goe from, are ſuch, as the Word of God doth warrant us to goe from?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto we anſwer; That wee may much more ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude upon that which we have above written, that becauſe we have a true Church, conſiſting of a lawfull miniſterie, and a faithfull people, therefore they cannot ſeparate themſelves from us, but they muſt needs incurre the moſt ſhamefull and odious reproach of manifeſt Schiſme.</p>
               <p>The places of holy Scripture which they alledge to warrant their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration by; we affirme to be of no force, to conclude that which they are brought for, which ſhall more plainely appeare when they are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of a part, and ſorted ſo, as the varietie of their nature requireth.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſort of their teſtimonies concerne only that private,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 13 <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.7, 10, 11 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, 14.15.</note> and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary familiaritie, which Chriſt hath forbidden to have with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that live in the Church, this ſhall appeare to bee the true meaning of the Apoſtle, even of that place of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. which in the 218. page of their refutation, and in ſundrie other places of their writings, they urge ſo, as it may ſeeme they judge it to be of more force, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, uſed by the Apoſtle, both in this place and the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. doth with a double compoſition with two ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, note a moſt familiar acquaintance and converſation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It cannot be ſhewed in all the Scripture, where this phraſe to (eate) being barely and generally ſet downe, without any adition is taken for the eating of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the Apoſtle had meant a ſeparation in the Church Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, he would have commanded the Church rather to cut off, and to put from them, theſe wicked men then to ſeparate themſelves from the wicked.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It appeareth by the tenth and eleventh verſes, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121037:41"/>together, that the Apoſtle wrote the ſecond time to cleare his meaning in that which hee had wrote before; And therefore in this place bee requireth no more ſeparation from brethren, that are fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and then the Corinthians did think he had (in a former letter) from ſuch fornicators were out of the Church; Now the Corinthians could never imagine, that when the Apoſtle forbad them to eate with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Infidels that were fornicators, and his meaning ſhould bee to forbid them the communicating with ſuch in the ſervice of God: for they never had accuſtomed to communicate ſo; And therefore the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he requireth, muſt needs be meant only of private, and voluntary familiarity. <hi>If they object that the Apoſtle in requiring ſeparation from the wicked in private converſation, doth much more forbid all ſocietie with them in the worſhip of God, ſeeing that thereby we joyne our ſelves much nearer together then by any civill fellowſhip</hi> (as they affirme in the 218. page of their refutation) Wee anſwer, that the reaſon followeth not; for, Firſt, It is in a private mans power to keepe from his firſt Table any wicked man, in whoſe hand, yet it lyeth not to ſhut any from the Lords Table.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Each Chriſtian as he is bound, by the commandement of God to the exerciſes of Religion, eſpecially in ſuch as are publike, ſo is he to forbeare the private farmiliaritie of the wicked.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Even as a Chriſtian may eate privately with a wicked man, or with an excommunicate perſon, in ſome caſes, when his company cannot be eſchewed, as being in an Armie, or Priſon, or ſhippe upon the Sea, amongſt a companie of vile wicked men, being by the Prince, or any other that hath power enforced either to doe ſo, or utterly to want all food, ſo much more is it lawfull for a Chriſtian to eate with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man at the Lords Table, wherein he is enforced either to doe ſo, or utterly to want all the great benefits and comfort that God offereth him in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of their Teſtimonies,<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.6.</note> whereby they labour to warrant their ſeparation, concerne only the avoyding and taking heede of falſe Prophets, blinde guides, hypocriticall, and prophane deceivers, and therefor they can with no peace to their conſciences, ground their ſeparation upon them, till they have ſufficiently proved, that not ſome of our Miniſters, but all are not only faultie in their practiſe, but teach alſo unſound, and corrupt doctrine, which they will never bee able to prove.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of their Teſtimonies,<note n="b" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14.18 <hi>

                        </gap>evel.</hi> 18.4</note> doe indeed partly concerne that ſeparation, which Chriſtians ſhould make from Idolatours in the ſervice of God, yet doe they no wayes ſerve, to juſtifie this their ſeparation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:121037:41"/>from us unleſſe they could prove (which they are not able to doe) that thoſe Aſſemblies which theſe Scriptures command a ſeparation from, were in the profeſſion of truth equall to us, or that the corruptions which are amongſt us, are equall unto ſuch as were in thoſe Aſſemblies. Beſides theſe teſt imonies, they ſeeke by two reaſons, to prove the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of their ſeparation from us, whereof the firſt is taken from the burt that may come to the true Chriſtian by communicating with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The other from the hurt he may doe to the wicked, with whom he doth communicate.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, they have theſe words; in the 97. page of their refutation. <hi>A little Leaven, leaveneth the whole lumpe, ſo one openly unworthy received to the Lords Supper, maketh all the Communicants guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> And in the 34. page of their diſcoverie; <hi>The knowne, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſinne of any one member is contagious to all ſuch as communicate in Prayers, and Sacraments, with ſuch an obſtinate offender, and maketh them as guiltie in Gods ſight, as he himſelfe is?</hi> Whereunto we anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That we have already proved by many examples (in the anſwer wee have above given unto the laſt thing they object againſt the people, and private members of our Church) that the godly receive no contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the wicked, with whom they are inforced to communicate in the true worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That their aſſertion may by reaſon, appeare evidently to be moſt abſurd, for if the preſence of the wicked ſhould of its own nature make the action of the Sacrament, and prayer voyd, and of none effect to the faithfull, that communicate with him, then ſhould we never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great doubting, and wavering communicate in thoſe holy exerciſes in ſuch a Congregation, where all that we joyne with, are not well knowne unto us, for feare their ſhould bee in the company, ſome open offendors whom our ſelves know not of. If our knowledge, and privity to his ſin, be the thing that maks his preſence contagious to us, eſpecially when we haye admoniſhed him,<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezec.</hi> 18.20.</note> and by all meanes teſtified our diſlike to his ſinne, ſo farre as in us lyeth. Then how is the Prophet to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, when he ſaith; the wickedneſſe of the wicked ſhall be upon his owne head, but admit this was granted that the preſence of the wicked in prayer, and Sacrament, did infect the godly, how will they excuſe their refuſall to heare the Word preached in our Aſſemblies, ſeeing it is ſo cleere by the Apoſtles ſpeech,<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25.</note> that the preaching of the Word, might be of force, to doe them good, though ſome that joyned with them in the hearing of it were Infidels.</p>
               <p>To their ſecond reaſon, <hi>wherein they pretend a charitable regard of us, who by their joyning with us in Gods worſhip, may be hardened in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:121037:42"/>of our corruptions, and by their ſeparation, may happily be brought to Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We anſwer, that the godly man who hath reproved the open offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſhunned his private familiarity, and hath gone ſo farre in teſtilying his diſlike to his ſinne, as the bounds of his calling will permit, is no way acceſſary to his ſinne, nor hath any fellowſhip with the <hi>unſruitfull workes of darkneſſe,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.11.</note> and if that any wicked man will imagine, that the godly doe not much diſlike him, becauſe they will not for his ſake, ſhun the publike worſhip of God; it is an offence taken and not given, and therefore ſuch as wherewith the conſcience of a godly man need not to be troubled.</p>
               <p>Thus have we anſwered, that which they pretend for the warrant, and neceſſitie of their ſeparation from our Aſſemblies. And now leaſt any ſhould be juſtly offended by thinking that in this apologie, we make for our Church, wee doe any way plead for <hi>Baal.</hi> or ſeeke to daube up the breaches of our Church with untempered morter, and ſo runne our ſelves into the danger or that curſe, which the Lord denounceth againſt them, <hi>that cal darkneſſe light, and ſpeake good of evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We therefore freely confeſſe, that there are (indeed) in our Church great corruptions, and that is the great ſinne of our Miniſters, that they doe not with ſo much zeale, and courage reveale and ſhew their diſtike of them, and of our people, that they mourne not, nor ſeeke by all hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and earneſt meanes to God, and the Magiſtrate for Reformation of them, as they ought to doe. And yet (though many in this Land, doe both know, and mourne, and make knowne alſo in their callings their great diſlike unto thoſe corruptions that are amongſt us, as much as any of theſe brethren with truth can doe, we dare conſidently affirme, that the corruptions of our Church, are not ſuch, as for which an. Chriſtian may make ſeparation from us, and that we are hereby induced to avouch, becauſe wee finde that in the Old, and New Teſtament, as hath beene above ſaid, as many, and as hainous corruptions to have beene in ſuch Aſſemblies, as from which no ſeparation was ever taught or practiſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though we did grant that (upon warrant of ſome places, that they bring) there might lawfully (upon due regard of ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances) a ſeparation be made even from our Aſſemblies, yet do we affirme, that for as much as they have failed in ſundry of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that therefore their ſeperation, is utterly unjuſtifiable, for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they could not with any juſt warrant to their conſciences, ſeperate themſelves from us, till they bad found us obſtinate in our corruptions, and temptuous ſcorners of all good meanes uſed for reforming us, (as is evident by the example of ſuch ſeparations as are commended in the

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 13.45.46. <hi>and</hi> 19.8, 9.</note> we affirme that they have departed from us before they could (with any charitie or good conſcience) be ſo perſwaded of us. And this we doubt not to prove to their owne conſciences, and to all that know them well, by theſe reaſons following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they ſeparated themſelves from us before that either by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or any competent meanes, they had ſoundly convicted us, or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted unto our judgement the dangerous errors we held, wherein they have manifeſtly tranſgreſſed the rule of the word:<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                        </gap>.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>and</hi> 3.10.</note> we grant indeed the truth and neceſſitie of the government of Chriſt preſcribed in the word, which hath beene ſufficiently manifeſted to the Church, and that our Church hath beene ſufficiently convinced of many groſſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but that for the want of ſome parts of diſcipline, our Church ſhould be no Church, or that for the corruptions amongſt us, our Miniſters ſhould be no true Miniſters, or our people no faithfull people (which are the very fundamentall principles of their Schiſme, and almoſt the very matter of difference betwixt them and us.) In theſe points wee deny that either to this day they have ſufficiently convinced us, or that before the firſt time of their ſeparation) they had in any meaſure uſed meanes to convince us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after they had convicted us in Judgement, they ſhould have (by brotherly admonition and exhortation, ſought to perſwade us unto the love and practiſe of the truth revealed, and to the hatred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of the manifeſted corruptions<note n="(b)" place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14.15. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.15.</note> which is evident they did not before their ſeparation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Scripture forbiddeth the Church to eject a private member, till in all patience and long ſuffering, his repentance hath been waited for, and the fruit of the aforeſaid meanes expected<note n="(c)" place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25 <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2.</note> which evidently reproveth their haſtie and ſudden departure from us, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or ſuddenly after they had uſed the meanes aboveſaid, eſpecially ſeeing that in all reaſon more long-ſufferance ſhould be vſed by ſuch private members as they were toward a whole Church, than by a whole Church towards private members.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas they ſhould have uſed all the meanes aboveſaid in meekneſſe, humilitie and love, mourning alſo for the hardneſſe of our hearts, whereby the meanes became fruſtrate unto us.<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.25.</note> It is evident that their zeale in dealing againſt us, hath beene like the raſh and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet zeale ſpoken of, and reproved in the ſons of <hi>Zebedeus.</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55.</note> And hath favoured altogether of uncharitableneſſe and not of love: for as all they that once have declined to that Schiſme, are found to be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proud and diſdainfull to wards all that are contrary minded; yea even ſuch as (before they were infected with that leaven) were patternes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:121037:43"/>of all love, modeſty and humility unto others; ſo will they not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nor reverence any of the moſt excellent graces that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto any of his ſervants amongſt us, nor ſo much reſpect them, as the very Papiſts will doe; no they profeſſe greater deteſtation and deſpite to the moſt godly and moſt ſincere men amongſt us, then they doe to ſuch as are moſt notorious in profanneſſe, and malice to the truth. To which purpoſe alſo wee deſire that the ſpirit whereby <hi>Henry Barrow</hi> was directed in writing his laſt bookes may be well examined.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, whereas by the equitie of the rule which our Saviour himſelfe giveth, and according to the practiſe of the Apoſtolike Church, wee ſhould have had our corruptions made knowne to ſome other Reformed Churches, and by them we ſhould have beene convinced and admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before theſe our brethren could rightly judge us as heathens and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes, we affirme that they (as if the Word of God had come out from them, or had come unto them onely) have by their diſorderly ſeparation, not onely deſpiſed and robbed us of our right; but all other chriſtian Churches in the world beſides.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, they have not ſo much as proteſted the cauſe of their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from us to the particular Congregations, whereof before their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture they were accounted by others, and did alſo acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be members.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly, thoſe of them which once exerciſed the places of the Miniſtrie amongſt us, and received for the ſame the reward due which they call <hi>Balaams</hi> wages, have not before, or ſince their departure, made actuall reſtitution of that which was (if their opinions be true) moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly received, nor yet ſhewed themſelves willing ſo to doe, to their abilitie which norwithhſtanding by the law of God they are moſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to doe.</p>
               <p>The ſcond Article in their concluſion is this, <hi>That the Aſſemblies which they goe and joyne themſelves unto, are ſuch as the Word of God commandeth them to goe unto:</hi> whereunto we give this anſwere. That if they had followed the direction of Gods Word when they had left us for our coruptions and wants as they charge us with, they ſhould have joyned themſelves to ſome other Reformed Churches which are pure from our corruptions, and amongſt whom the diſcipline of Chriſt is rightly eſtabliſhed: as we finde the faithfull Levites and people did in the dayes of <hi>Iiroboam</hi> and every wiſe hearted Chriſtian, will hold it to be a reaſon of great force againſt them that they have made ſeparation, not from us onely; but from all other Reformed Churches in the world: For there by they appeare to have beene of this judgement, that till they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:121037:43"/>aroſe, there was not a true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtituted viſible Church in the whole world knowne unto them: unto which they might have joyned themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Aſſemblies which they erected, and joyned themſelves unto, if they be looked into with a Chriſtian and indifferent eye, ſhall well appeare to be much more deformed than many of thoſe are, which they have for ſaken, for proofe whereof, we deſire the Readers, to weigh well with the weights of the Sanctuary, and to try by the touchſtone of the Word certaine points of doctrine, which they have both brewed, and broached to the world in their printed Books. Then ſecondly their practiſe and diſpoſitions. All their Paradoxes, and abſurd opinions, we will not ſet downe, but in ſome few, we will give the Readers a taſte of the reſt.</p>
               <p>In the 138. page of their diſcovery they affirme, <hi>That ſuch an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous ſhape cleaveth to every ſtone of our Materiall Charches, as by no meanes can be ſevered from them, while there is a ſtone left ſtanding upon a ſtone,</hi> ſo that neither they can be uſed to the worſhip of God, nor we have any uſe of them, ſeeing that they are execrable, and devoted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. In the 167. page of the ſame booke they teach: <hi>That to every Chriſtian God hath given his boly ſanctifying ſpirit, to open unto them, and to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Touching the Magiſtrates authority, beſides that by the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their writings, it appeareth, that they hold the people may take in hand the publike Reformation of the Church, and erect the whole diſcipline not only without, but contrary to the Chriſtian Magiſtrates liking and conſent; they doe alſo directly affirme, page 218 and 219. of their diſcovery: <hi>That God hath in the holy Scripture made moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and neceſſary Lawes, both for the Church, and Common-wealth, and that he requireth of the King, and Magistraſe, to ſee their Lawes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and not to make new.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither doe they judge ever a whit more dutifully of the Churches of God, for of them they uſe to ſpeake, as if their had beene no true Church in the world, till they ſprung up. Nor were at this time any right conſtituted Church Aſſembly in the world, but their owne: for in the Epiſtie to the Reader which they prefixed before their diſcovery and in the firſt page thereof, they have theſe words. <hi>The whole land (I ſay not the whole World) hath lyen ſo long, and is ſo deepe ſet in the def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:121037:44"/>wee wonder that they iudge ſo erroniouſly of men, ſeeing the ſacred Worſhip of God, they hold, that it may receive pollution from men that deale in it, for in the 30. page of their diſcovery, <hi>They teach that the open ſinne of the Miniſter, defileth the Sacrament, and Prayer, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Touching the Articles of our faith, which by all the godly, in all ages have beene called the Apoſtles creed; Thus they ſpeake, in the 76. page of their diſcoverie: <hi>Their forged patchry, commonly called the Apoſtls Creede.</hi> The Article of Chriſts deſcending into Hell what ſence ſoever it be taken in, they call in the 48. page of their refutation; <hi>That Blaſphemous Article of our Faith.</hi> Beſides theſe groſſe abſurdities they hold againſt other points of wholſome doctrine, let the Reader gueſſe at the judgment they have in the manner of Church government (wherein they would appeare to be better ſeene, then all the godly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world beſides) by theſe few things. which we will offer to his conſideration. Firſt, whereas they have in their writings, diſclaimed the diſcipline which wee deſire, and other reformed Churches have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, they have never yet clearely ſet downe, what diſcipline it is w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> themſelves ſtand ſo much for. In the 27. page of their diſcoverie, when they have ſcoffed at the diſcipline we ſeeke, they offer words to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. <hi>That without the power, and practiſe of the diligent watch of every member, but chiefly of the Rulers, and Elders, the Word of God is made as Idoll, the Sacrament ſacriledge unto us, and all things we doe, odious and abominable to the Lord:</hi> Whereby it appeareth, they are of opinion, that there can be no true Religion there, where either, there is no Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip eſtabliſhed, or where the Elders faile in the execution of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or where any one private member of the Church ſhall faile in doing the Office of a Watchman, and cenſurer to the reſt, much like to this, is that which they write in the 37. page of their refutation, <hi>Hath the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Miniſter in the Church, any more power to retaine, and looſe the ſinne of the leaſt member, then the ſame member, hath to binde, or looſe his ſinne.</hi> In the 119. page of their diſcoverie, ſpeaking of the Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. which hath beene ſought for amongſt us, and received by other reformed Churches, they have theſe words. <hi>The thing it ſelfe they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, in that they adde new deviſes of their owne, as their Paſtorall ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:121037:44"/>when they affirme, <hi>that the Church hath no power, to make any Loves of indifferent things.</hi> And page 193. of their diſcovery; <hi>That the people, without any Miniſter, may give ordination, and full calling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the miniſtery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As their judgment is erronious, ſo is the practiſe of their diſcipline in their Aſſemblies moſt diſorderly; For, firſt none can gather Churches from Infidelitie, nor may goe about it, but only ſuch as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to it, by our Saviour Chriſt, and he hath appointed none for that worke but Miniſters, which alſo themſelves in the fourth page of the preface, prefixed to the refutation, doe confeſſe, we would gladly know by what miniſtrie, their Aſſemblies were firſt gathered; by what preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie were the Miniſters, that firſt gathered their Aſſemblies examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ordained with impoſition of hands: Secondly, when the firſt were gathered, what foundation had they to ground their faith, and doctrine upon (eſpecially in theſe point of controverſie) when they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had any other tranſlation of the Scripture then that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from us, whom they judged no better than Heretickes, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, nor any one among them, who by the knowledge in the tongues, was able to examine our tranſlation, by the originall Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How great a diſorder it is, that in their Aſſemblies, private perſons are allowed to interpret the Scriptures publikely; and that they hold faith may even ordinarily be wrought by privatemen. Where <hi>God</hi> hath ſeparated, and ſanctified a ſpeciall ſort of men, to any office, and the adminiſtration thereunto belonging; there he hath reſtrained others, that are not of that ſort, from, ordinarie doing of the actions properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto that office, as may appeare by many Teſtimonies, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; Now it is evidant that in the Old, and in the New Teſtament, the Lord did ſeperate the Prieſts, and Levites, Apoſtles, Prophets, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelifts, Paſtors, and Teachers, to the publicke Adminiſtration of the Word, and Prayer of the Sacrifices, and Sacraments of the Church, how then ſhall any other preſumo to meddle there with?</p>
               <p>The Prieſts and Levites, who had ever by inheritance, ſome right to all the ſervices of the Tabernacle might not lawfully exerciſe the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſervice, till they were ſpecially called, and conſecrated thereunto,<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.34.</note> how much leſſe then, might any other deale in the publike ſervice of God without a publike calling thereunto? Wee are not ignorant that they are wont to alleadge many teſtimonies of Scripture, to warrant this diſorder by, but alas they doe it very ignorantlie; For many of them whoſe examples they cite, were by ſpeciall calling ſeparated to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of preaching.</p>
               <p>The ſeventie Diſciples are ſaid to have beene ſent by CHRIST,

                  <note n="d" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2.</note> who ſhould teach others alſo, were ſuch only, as ſhold be both inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Timothy,</hi> and receive authoritie from him to do it. Of ſome other mentioned in their quotations, it is very probable, that they were not private men, but had a ſpeciall calling to the Office of preaching. The Diſciples, that being ſcattered through perſecutions went about preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may very well be thought to have beene Miniſters, rather than pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, unleſſe we ſhall imagine there were no Miniſters in <hi>Iernfalem</hi> before the Church was ſcattered, but the Apoſtles only, and <hi>Philip</hi> who is alſo called an Evangeliſt, is the only man of name amongſt all theſe ſcattered Diſciples, that preached; The Prophets mentioned in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. is very likely, were either ſuch as whoſe extraordinarie gifts did ſuficientlie prove to the Church, that they were extraordinari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as they cannot conclude out of theſe places, that thoſe Prophets were meere private men, ſo ſhall they not f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As not onely Maſter <hi>Francis Johnſon,</hi> but ſundrie other of their Miniſters have beene.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:121037:45"/>Sure wee are that herein they have done directly contrary to the rule of the holy Apoſtle, and for ſmaller faults then this they are ready to ſay againſt us in the 127. page of their refutation, <hi>That he that hath not a true and right calling unto his Office, is no true Miniſter; but an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, an Intruder, a Thiefe, a Murderer, &amp;c.</hi> But what ſhall we need to reckon up any more of the diſorders that may be noted in their Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeeing it is not poſſible but that thoſe Aſſemblies ſhould be full of confuſion and diſorder, where no Church cenſure can paſſe without the conſent of every private man, and wherein every member is made equall in power and authoritie with the Miniſters and Elders of the Church. Theſe things being ſo, what is there to be ſeene amongſt them, whereby ſo many ſimple Chriſtians are deceived and moved to forſake us, and joyne to them? Save onely that ſhew of ſinceritie and zeale, and holy converſation wherein they are thought to go far beyond any of us.</p>
               <p>Concerning which wee ſay, that although the coverſation of many of our people and Miniſters alſo be very ſcandalous, and the lives of the beſt of us, far ſhort of that perfection we dayly ſtrive unto: Yet it ſhall well appeare to him that will rightly conſider theſe few lines following, That the power of true godlineſſe is much more wanting amongſt them then 'tis with us, whom they have forſaken; for it we may judge of the ſchollers by their teachers and of the miſerable ſeduced mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by their chief Leaders, and if men do not uſe to ſpeak, much leſſe to write: but from the abundance of their harts, then have they as ſmal cauſe certainlie to boſt of their holines, &amp; to ſay they are not as other men, nor as we are, whom they have forſaken, as the Phariſee in the Goſpel ſaid:<note n="(b)" place="margin">

In the ninth page of their Diſcovery they ſay, <hi>That all the Atheists, Papists, and Anabaptists, and Heretiques of all ſorts, Whores, Theeves, Witches, Conjurers, and who not, that dwelleth in this Iſland, or is within the Queenes dominions, are received and nouriſhed within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of this Church, with the Word and Sacraments; none are refuſed, none kept out.</hi> In the 60. page of their Diſcovery they ſay, <hi>Theſe Priests and people retaine the Leviticall Decimations in the ſame forme, to the ſame end.</hi> In the 63. and 64. pages they affirme, <hi>That the ſervice book is the very ground worke of our Faith, Church, and Miniſtry, from
